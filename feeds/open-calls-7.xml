Time wears all things. Literally taken weathering is an aspect of the elements, but not without time. Wind, rain, sun, fire, and ice, and even mechanical means, transform everything. Weathering then is the process by which things in our world, and the world itself, are in the process of always becoming. In appreciating such processes one becomes aware of the signs of surviving age, stress, life, the toll of an ordeal or accomplishment, and existence itself. Through weathering a compelling narrative unfolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists are encouraged to take a broadly creative view in interpreting the theme¬†as it applies to their work. Submissions can range from the most traditional realism to the most conceptual, abstract, or experimental.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$40 for up to FOUR entries submitted. $5 per each additional entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospectus and entry form visit &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org/weathered." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Email info@manifestgallery.org with questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/be7d6785-a907-4a2e-8df7-ea07fa595957" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>1775b078-a8e8-4c0f-a18f-ee759eb00984</id><title>11/15 - EXPO 39 Juried Competition and Exhibition</title><updated>2019-10-18T11:27:17.778382+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;bj spoke gallery, Huntington, NY&lt;br/&gt;üìç Huntington, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 11/15/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $35.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.bjspokegallery.org"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a juries show accepting entries for all visual fine arts media, including video,and will consider works of all artists living within the United States.

Subordinate! Uneducated! These are a few of many terms that are commonly associated with black people. This exhibition gives black artists an opportunity to rewrite the script that has been forced upon them by showing a side that is often ignored.  Though many people do not agree with such associations, these stereotypes are still at the forefront of media and society which creates division within black communities and their multiethnic counterparts. This exhibition blurs the line between how black people are portrayed and who they truly are outside of their race. By focusing on the artistic interests of black artists, viewers not only reflect on the many forms that inspiration and creativity can take but challenge the false portrayals of black people in society.&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY&lt;br/&gt;Professional artists as well as student artists are encouraged to enter. Entries must represent original works of art that address the stated theme. There is no size restriction, other than what can fit through our gallery doors.

Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as ‚Äúcontent‚Äù, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices‚Äô push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world‚Äîpeople to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it‚Ä¶For better or worse, then, the ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of ‚Äòmore‚Äô. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe‚Äîwhere we can find them‚Äîjoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pleasure of ‚Äòmore is more‚Äô may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, ‚Äòthe bigger, brighter, busier, the better‚Äô was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency‚Äîgenerating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul‚Äôs rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff‚Äôs reframing of ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work‚Äù in her P &amp; D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida‚Äôs art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer‚Äôs lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, ‚Äúhow much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can‚Äôt already afford?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People, go for baroque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLICATION GUIDELINES + CURATORIAL REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are separate applications for the New York City and Los Angeles shows. Please note that curators may apply to both the New York City and Los Angeles shows and will need to submit separate applications for each show to be considered for either and/or both. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEADLINES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications will be accepted by independent curators, galleries and non-profit organizations during the application period between October 1 - November 22, 2019. The online application form will be available during those dates until November 22, 2019 at 11:59pm your time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No proposals nor applications will be accepted via email.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APPLICATION FEE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a non-refundable application fee of $100.00 per application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our mission is to create an unique environment for showcasing independent curators by providing free exhibition space to each selected curator, and therefore, require an application fee to cover our administrative fees for processing the applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO MAY APPLY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) INDEPENDENT CURATORS: Independent Curators may submit an application for the 2020 SPRING/BREAK Art Show, including a curatorial proposal related to the theme of IN EXCESS, sample images of art work, a curatorial statement and additional information necessary to complete the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that artists may apply as an Independent Curator only if they are applying with a group show or a solo show of another artist's work. An artist may not apply with their own art work in a solo show, but must have a curator who applies on behalf of him/her/they.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is NO FEE for the exhibition space if you are selected as an independent curator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) GALLERIES + PROJECT SPACES + NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS: Applicants affiliated with a gallery or project space/non-profit organization may submit a curatorial proposal comprised of artists from the gallery's roster and this curatorial proposal will fall into our SPECIAL PROJECT section. If you have an affiliation with a gallery, project space or non-profit organization, please define your affiliation/title and include the full roster of artists in the application below for our reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Project section was initated in 2015 as a way to invite established, new and recently closed galleries to participate in the show. We encourage participants in the Special Project section to explore the theme in full and to go beyond what they typically would do in a traditional art fair environment. In 2019, there were 26 Special Projects as part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Special Project contributes a fee to participate, which helps to cover the production costs of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on applying at an Independent Curator, Gallery or a Non-Profit Organization, please visit our website for more details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.springbreakartshow.com/2020-application/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTED CURATORIAL APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission of an application does not guarantee participation. We will review applications in December and notify selected curators by the beginning of January, if not before. If we have any questions about your proposal, we will contact the primary curator listed on the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each curatorial proposal will be given one (1) room/space for exhibiting artworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected curators will receive a consignment agreement to review and complete. All artworks included in the show must be included in and subject to the terms of the consignment agreement. Artworks that are not listed on the consignment agreement will not be permitted on the show premises.

This open theme invites meaningful creative interpretations of contemporary society and our relationship with the environment from a variety of perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three focus areas of ELEMENTS are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Location-specific environmental issues, such as the California Wildfires or the Flint Water Crisis&lt;br/&gt;2. Creative, sustainable infrastructure such as an innovative way to divert/reuse campus plastic waste, alternative power, a way to reuse storm/gray water, or a plant-material mural to clean the air, that will lessen the eco-footprint of the campus&lt;br/&gt;3. Art that promotes environmental consciousness from lenses such as consumption, commoditization of natural resources, intersectionality and human rights( Ex.

Lingen has collaborated with over 70 celebrated artists and writers, including Jim Dine, Kiki Smith, Leonardo Drew, Shepard Fairey, Robert Ryman, Mary Heilmann, Jessica Stockholder, Jane Hammond, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Creeley and Matthew Day Jackson.

Artists are invited to consider and respond to the following considerations and questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As symbols of Confederate and Colonial power are currently being destroyed, dismantled, reconfigured, or exiled from public view, what new representations should fill their void? What monuments should be created to reflect today‚Äôs values and our desire to project those into the future? Who or what should be given the space, representation, and honor in these new monumental artworks? More specifically, as the reconfiguration of monuments in public space reflects the process of history writing, what histories of New York should be remembered or recovered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kind of monument might shape public consciousness in the creation of civic agents empowered with social and political self-determination? What kind of monument might best to serve and preserve the reclamation of New York‚Äôs under-recognized or repressed histories? How might monument-makers resist the obdurate, authoritarian chauvinist impulses that commonly accompany traditional representational strategies of monuments?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This open call will be the major component of Socrates Sculpture Park‚Äôs year-long engagement with recent discourse on the current state and future of monuments in the United States. It is a thematic adaption of ‚ÄòThe Socrates Annual Fellowship‚Äô and exhibition, and incorporates an extended selection process and production timeline as well as inclusion in an exhibition publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These monument prototypes for New York City will be presented alongside three new commissions for speculative monuments for America by major artists, and a collective monument for Queens created by participants in the Park‚Äôs after-school program for teenagers: Socrateens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellowship recipients will receive a $5,000 production grant to support their project a $1,000 honorarium and four-months of seven-days-a-week access to the resources and fabrication facilities of the Park‚Äôs outdoor artist studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist Fellows are responsible for the fabrication, transportation (if necessary) and installation of their works. Socrates will provide limited technical and installation assistance during a three-week installation period, M-F, 10AM ‚Äì 6PM. Specifics of installation assistance will be discussed with each artist selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SITE &amp; CONTEXT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before preparing their applications, artists are strongly encouraged to visit Socrates ‚Äì a unique New York City public park located on the East River waterfront in an industrial area of Long Island City, Queens ‚Äì and to explore Socrates‚Äô website and exhibition archive to learn about the history and context of the organization. Visiting the Park will give applicants a better sense of the factors that effect installations in the Park and help impart insights into the available facilities ‚Äì from the tools and equipment in Socrates‚Äô artist studio to the resources of the surrounding neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REVIEW PROCESS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄòThe Socrates Annual Fellowship program‚Äô is based on a competitive, open application process. Completed on-line applications must be submitted by the deadline (Monday, November 25, 2019 by 11:59pm) and will be reviewed by the Socrates exhibition department and outside curatorial advisors. Ten to twelve artists will be selected for the 2020 program. Artists are selected based on the compelling nature of the project proposed, clarity of intent, unique approach to the site, and public context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the recommendations of the curatorial advisors, Socrates staff will contact applicants individually to discuss proposed projects before confirming the final selection in early 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FELLOWSHIP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once accepted, Socrates staff members will meet with each Artist Fellow to discuss project proposals in detail and begin to assist with the development, engineering, and installation of the work. A group meeting for all Artist Fellows and Socrates staff will take place one evening in late winter of 2020, followed by an on-site orientation and individual progress meetings throughout the Fellowship to assess progress, troubleshoot issues, and review next steps. Selected works are subject to final approval by Socrates staff and must meet safety requirements to be able to withstand the effects of weather and public use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellowships are awarded to artists whose careers and artistic practices would benefit from the opportunity.

Known for fostering ambitious and visionary artworks, Socrates has presented more than 1,200 artists on its five waterfront acres, providing them the financial support, materials, equipment, and space necessary to create large-scale works in the public realm.

This grant, titled Fringe Populi: Building Audiences through Public Performance, seeks to ‚Äúbuild new audiences through large-scale public practice works [that] generate both wide attention through scale, spectacle, and resonance of content,‚Äù and that provide ‚Äúmore focused, deeper engagement with individuals recruited to participate in the work.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous examples of public practice pieces stewarded by FringeArts include Le Grand Continental (2012, Sylvain √âmard), 100% Philadelphia (2014, Rimini Protokoll), Gala (2016, Jer√¥me Bel), Le Super Grand Continental (2018, Sylvain √âmard), and √öumbal: Nomadic Choreography for Inhabitants (2019, Mariana Arteaga). The 2020 Fringe Populi piece will be the culminating performance in the Fringe Populi New Audiences New Places grant that aims to break down perception barriers which keep the Philadelphia public from engaging in contemporary performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Artist‚Äôs piece should aim to engage between 100-250 performers at varying levels of engagement and commitment. Artist proposals will provide a clear outline of project dramaturgy, recruitment, rehearsal structure, and performance. The priorities of the Fringe Populi project are to cultivate wide encounters of contemporary performance with the Philadelphia public, present work that is free and outdoors, and to engage with civically-activated spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal applications open on Monday, September 9th and are due back to FringeArts by 5:00pm on Monday, October 7th. Please read the Fringe Populi Requirements and Guidelines closely before starting your application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To apply, please fill out this form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions?

Residents explore the possibilities of prints, publications, or multiples, and have the time to develop a focused project on a variety of cutting edge and traditional print equipment with the assistance of Paper Machine staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOOKS: &lt;br/&gt;DEADLINE: 10/17&lt;br/&gt;FEE: $20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antenna publishes new Comic Books, Chapbooks, or Guidebooks, all through open call processes.

Accepted artists into the Damaged Art exhibit will have their works for sale for the price of their full, outstanding student loan debt ‚Äî not only to alleviate their financial burden, but to bring a new awareness to the realities these artists are faced with. This selection will be done by a panel of esteemed judges with cultural and artistic significance in New York City and beyond to bring further awareness to this important cause and uplift the burgeoning talent it threatens to stifle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time has come to expose the corruptness of the student loan system in the United States. Damaged Art has an agenda to unveil the scandalous nature that loan companies have used to unknowingly sign students up for a lifetime fairytale deal with the devil. Many students have no choice but to sign up for loans that lead to enormous interest rates, monthly payments that are akin to extortion, and constant harassment that threatens their livelihood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damaged Art is an exhibit conceived and curated by New York artist, Cheryl Georgette. For years she has assisted fine artist Vera Lutter in New York City and Los Angeles, in which she was an artist and resident at LACMA. Prior to working as an assistant, she worked various positions in the photography and art industry: Ruby Bird Studio, Gowanus Darkroom, The Studio at the Darkroom, Alt Citizen, and Animazing Gallery. The exhibit will focus on New York artists, but has plans to expand to other cities nationwide to continue bringing awareness to young talent and the hardships they face in order to be able to create. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damaged Art is a submission based art show. Open call is Sept 17-Oct 9. The exhibition will be held at lower east side gallery, 98 Orchard on November 8-10. Stay tuned for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply for the exhibition, click on the "Apply Now" button on the Damaged Art website. www.damaged-art.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artwork submitted to DAMAGED ART for the exhibition must be unique works by the artist, no limited editions will be accepted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists may submit 1 - 3 works of art for consideration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Must Submit Artist Statement and Student Loan Story: Please provide a paragraph, no longer than 200 words, of your personal journey with student loan debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must provide an estimated amount of your entire student loan debt: a combination of federal and private loans. Personal loans do not apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submit website and/or social media links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAMAGED ART will notify you by October 21st if your work is accepted in the exhibition. We may request to see additional work, or ask that you elaborate on your story, if necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selection process will be determined by esteemed Judges, the week of October 14, 2019. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Announcement of accepted artists is Monday, October 21, 2019. Accepted artists then MUST provide verification of the amount of their TOTAL student loan debt: including federal, private and any loans in default. Prove your student loan debt amount by sending current statements, and DAMAGED ART will determine the price of your artwork, factoring in an interest that may accrue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If accepted into the exhibition, we will require that you verify your student loan debt. It is understandable that your estimated student loan amount submitted for the Open Call may differ to the actual owed debt. Please do not let that discourage showing us the actual amount owed. The exhibition‚Äôs purpose is to pull off the bandaid, and show and tell your financial story.

This expanded definition included mark-making that ventured off the paper, into multimedia, film, sculpture and much else. However, in recent years, many artists have returned to a more gestural and representational mode. In this new and dynamic tension between tradition and experimental visions, Site:Brooklyn is looking for works, across all mediums and processes, which showcase the diversity and range of drawing‚Äôs place in contemporary art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Olga Valle Tetkowski is currently deputy director at The Drawing Center in NYC.

Throughout the canon of art history, the human figure has been a central theme, as we grapple with our own existence, feeding a desire to self represent and to understand our place in the universe. This exhibition will present works by contemporary artists who address the figure not just as an object of beauty, or a subject of anatomy, but rather elaborate on contemporary themes of body positive depictions of the human form, including all body types, ages and genders, celebrating diversity as well as the timeless beauty of the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Body Positivity? The body-positive movement, which dates back to early Victorian reforms against the corset, 1960‚Äôs initiatives against fat-shaming, and more recently via social media with influencers challenging unrealistic standards of beauty, is ‚Äúrooted in the belief that all human beings should have a positive body image, while challenging the ways in which society presents and views the physical body. The goal of the movement is to address unrealistic beauty standards and to build the confidence of oneself and others. The movement sets forth the notion that beauty is a construct of society, and poses that this construct should not infringe upon one's ability to feel confidence or self-worth. The movement states that neither fat-shaming nor skinny-shaming is acceptable, and that all body types can and should be celebrated.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ‚ÄúBody Beautiful‚Äù exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works will be considered in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, and performance amongst others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group show will take place at The Untitled Space gallery in Tribeca, New York, as well as online on Artsy. The exhibit is open to submissions until September 30, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE&lt;br/&gt;The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street.

As such, we seek to provide alternative exhibition platforms to the vast network of independent curators who offer new ways of seeing, understanding, and experiencing artists and their works. The program creates an opportunity for a curator to realize an exhibition concept and bring it to the public in Detroit. The selected curator will demonstrate in their proposal a level of engagement and thoughtfulness about how their exhibition engages with the local city and community, and why it should take place in Detroit. Red Bull Arts Detroit will support the curator in the execution of the exhibition and its public programming. The exhibition will open in July of 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curator receives access to our 12,000 square foot gallery for their exhibition as well as financial, production, and marketing support to execute their vision. For Detroit-based curators, the fellowship will provide travel and accommodation for five trips for planning purposes outside of the city in advance of the exhibition. For non-Detroit based curators, Red Bull Arts Detroit will provide travel for three trips to Detroit in advance of the exhibition for planning purposes, three-trips to Detroit during the exhibition for programming purposes, and accommodations in Detroit during visits. The selected curator will receive a $5000 fee. The budget for the production of the exhibition is $15,000 along with funding for three-to-four public programs. Outside of the $15,000, Red Bull Arts Detroit will provide in-kind support that includes local installation staff, staffing for gallery hours, access to technology for use in exhibition (list of available technology is at - &lt;a href="http://redbullarts.com/detroit/exhibition-equipment-and-technology/" target="_blank"&gt;http://redbullarts.com&lt;/a&gt;), printing wall texts (labels and vinyl) as well as gallery guides, and installation documentation of the exhibition. The curator should plan for the $15,000 exhibition budget to cover any artist fees, production fees for works or installation materials, artist travel, shipping and handling of art works, commissioning of new writing or texts, and any other materials or labor otherwise required for the production of their exhibition concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Guidelines&lt;br/&gt;- The Red Bull Arts Detroit Curatorial Fellowship takes place once a year&lt;br/&gt;- Applications are open August 19th ‚Äì September 30th, 2019, with selected projects presented in July of 2020.&lt;br/&gt;- Applicants should regularly curate contemporary art exhibitions, drawing from the disciplines of visual, sound, or performance art.&lt;br/&gt;- Applicants must submit a CV, Statement of Purpose, and project proposal.

Bidders are encouraged to develop their own understanding of the context of her life and her achievements. The key objectives are to create a lasting tribute to Rosalie Gardiner Jones that is integrated with the Cold Spring Harbor State Park site and utilizes materials that are durable and require minimal maintenance and care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jones was an outspoken advocate for woman‚Äôs suffrage, most often on the grass roots level. She not only&lt;br/&gt;travelled across Long Island with her yellow ‚ÄúSuffrage Wagon,‚Äù she also campaigned for women‚Äôs suffrage&lt;br/&gt;in New York City, Washington, DC, and across the country. Most famously, she led a ‚Äúhike‚Äù from the Bronx&lt;br/&gt;to Albany in December 1912 to present a petition to the newly elected governor urging that women be given&lt;br/&gt;the right to vote. Two months later, ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù Jones led her ‚ÄúArmy of the Hudson‚Äù on another march or&lt;br/&gt;‚Äúpilgrimage‚Äù from Newark, New Jersey, to Washington, DC, to participate in the famous suffrage parade on&lt;br/&gt;the eve of Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs inauguration. Jones and her followers wore long brown pilgrim capes for this&lt;br/&gt;march and their second hike up the west side of the Hudson to Albany in 1914. These marches gained extensive publicity for the suffrage cause in newspapers throughout the country and resulted in General&lt;br/&gt;Jones becoming a national celebrity. She spoke for suffrage in Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, and&lt;br/&gt;New Jersey. Jones also led parades on Long Island, flew over Staten Island in a bi-plane dropping suffrage&lt;br/&gt;leaflets, and campaigned throughout New York State in a yellow suffrage automobile, spreading the gospel&lt;br/&gt;of Votes for Women. Jones was born in New York City, but spent much of her life in the family mansion on&lt;br/&gt;the west side of Cold Spring Harbor, opposite what is now Cold Spring Harbor State Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monument to memorialize ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù Jones should engage the public. It should communicate the&lt;br/&gt;strength and courage exhibited by Jones as she endeavored to make women‚Äôs suffrage a reality through its&lt;br/&gt;materiality, its form and its setting. The proposed monument should consider the terrain and underground&lt;br/&gt;structures, flora and fauna at the site, as well as views and access to the street, parking lots, and waterfront.&lt;br/&gt;The design of the site should welcome visitors to linger near the artwork to contemplate women‚Äôs suffrage&lt;br/&gt;and equal rights for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please apply through the New York State Contract Reporter website:  &lt;a href="http://www.nyscr.ny.gov/adsOpen.cfm?ID=77B04B69-54CD-48B7-A966-053D540DDB16." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nyscr.ny.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An optional, but highly recommended, site visit is scheduled for October 8, 2019, at 1pm.
