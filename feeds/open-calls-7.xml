We invite artists, designers, coders, technologists, engineers, architects, and citizens alike to submit their proposals for the event. All submissions should use at least one of NYC‚Äôs open datasets, available through Open Data Portal. (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of our event will be Digital Twin, a term used to describe a virtual replica of a real world object or phenomenon. Digital twins ‚Äî avatars, simulation models and artificial intelligence ‚Äî constitute virtual worlds which can be used to both interpret and shape our reality. How are individuals, societies, cities and natural systems reflected in and impacted by digital worldbuilding? How can they help us better understand ourselves and our reality? On the other hand, how can implicit or explicit bias distort or mislead such efforts, and what are the consequences when we lose control of these digital worlds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of Data through Design and Open Data Week, a city-wide endeavor by the NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office of Data Analytics, is to encourage a wider knowledge of New York City‚Äôs open datasets and how these resources can enable better public understanding of what is happening in NYC‚Äôs neighborhoods, schools, streets, and parks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deadline to submit a proposal is January 20th. Selected artists will be announced by January 27th, and must have their works ready for installation by February 27th.

From the Neolithic period onwards, textiles, metals, glass, stone, and other materials were laboriously and carefully woven into images and figures, marking the intersecting and complex paths of commerce, religious and domestic life, and the arts. The Industrial Revolution begin the mass manufacture of textiles, making them available to ever larger swaths of society. These materials and methods have been increasingly integrated into the fine arts, creating a flourishing and exciting conjunction. What is the place, and future of craft in contemporary art? Site:Brooklyn is looking to answer this question, with works that range across all styles and mediums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Juror:&lt;br/&gt;Samantha De Tillio is a curator and writer specializing in modern and contemporary craft. She is Assistant Curator at the Museum of Arts and Design, where her upcoming exhibition Beth Lipman: Collective Elegy (May 14, 2020 to March 28, 2021) is the artist‚Äôs first midcareer survey. She is also a Contributing Editor for GLASS: The UrbanGlass Art Quarterly and her ongoing personal research includes the first in-depth study of the life and fiber sculpture of Dorian Zachai (1932-2015). She has worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, and the Albany Institute of History and Art in various curatorial and research capacities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Gallery:&lt;br/&gt;Site:Brooklyn Gallery located in Brooklyn, New York is dedicated to exhibiting the current practice of contemporary artists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dates:&lt;br/&gt;Call Announcement: December 13, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Final Submission Deadline: February 3, 2020 11:59 PM MT&lt;br/&gt;Notification Letter: February 12, 2020&lt;br/&gt;Gallery Exhibition: March 20, 2019‚Äì April 18, 2020&lt;br/&gt;Opening Reception: Friday, March 13, 2019 from 6-9 PM&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Eligibility:&lt;br/&gt;This is a juried exhibition for artists working in drawing across all mediums.

These are animals.‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;Donald J. Trump on immigration, 2018&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Race and Revolution: Home/Land, the fourth art exhibition in a series that confronts historical patterns of systemic racism in the United States, is putting out an open call to emerging artists of all media whose work relates to and engages in conversation with the themes related to the enduring impact of government-sanctioned family separation, bounty hunting, and detention for border crossing. For the open call, we would like to view completed works that address this topic and/or proposals for work related to the topic. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Home/Land will look at the influence of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 on Lewis Latimer‚Äôs family, focusing on the tactics used to detain, deport, and re-enslave ‚Äúrunaways‚Äù with current practices used by Immigration Customs Enforcement to control the influx of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. The exhibition will pair true stories of those who escaped or attempted to escape slavery in the years surrounding the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 with current experiences of families attempting to migrate to the United States with the hope of finding a home in the land of the free. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Eight to ten artists will be given access to primary source documents from the past to create works that show a connection between then and now. Basing their art pieces on families‚Äô migration journeys and their encounters with ICE brings the pain of the past into the present. Excerpts from historical documents: runaway slave ads, letters, journal entries, will be posted on the wall next to the art piece. Displayed together, the documents and the artworks will ask viewers what, if anything, has changed regarding how this country treats humans labeled as ‚Äúillegal‚Äù.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thematic Questions&lt;br/&gt;‚óèWhat does ‚Äúhome‚Äù mean?&lt;br/&gt;‚óèWhat is the relationship between one‚Äôs home and one‚Äôs homeland?&lt;br/&gt;‚óèDo you think a home and a homeland is a human right? &lt;br/&gt;‚óèHow can we, as informed people, condemn how enslaved people seeking freedom were treated as a result of the Fugitive Slave Act, yet continue to dehumanize people who are seeking better lives for their families?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:&lt;br/&gt;Projects in all media are welcome (though see ‚Äúexhibit specifications‚Äù section below for specific requirements). We are also open to temporary indoor or outdoor event proposals that engage with this theme, from both artists and community organizations. Artists are especially encouraged to propose community workshops that complement artwork on view in the gallery (as opposed to stand-alone events).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO SUBMIT: Please email ONE PDF file with all requested information including images/videos or links to images/videos to info@lewislatimerhouse.org under the title ‚ÄúHome/Land Submission.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief description (approx. 1 paragraph or 500 words) of proposed project‚Äìplease address how it engages the exhibition theme!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚óè Up to 10 images/videos of the proposed project and/or related work, or send links to images/videos online.

The main goals are to spread the knowledge in the field of visual arts and to introduce the students to the professions related to the art world, focusing on contemporary curatorial theory and practice and contemporary museology. The School‚Äôs activities are meant for all those interested and passionate in art, graduated students or professionals who want to deepen their knowledge and improve their practical skills. The School‚Äôs teaching staff is formed by Italian and international professionals, scholars, historians and art critics of recognized experience. Among them: Matt Williams (curator), Filippo Lotti (Sotheby‚Äôs), Chiara Barbieri (Peggy Guggenheim Collection), Francesca Colasante (Pinault Collection), Andrea Goffo (Found. Prada), Nicola Lees (Serpentine London).&lt;br/&gt;The program:&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School in Curatorial Practice will take place during the 17th International Architecture Biennale Venice. With an interdisciplinary approach, the course provides practical training and experience within museums and exhibition settings. Its international faculty includes curators and museum professionals, artists and critics. The course is designed to increase students understanding of the intellectual and technical tasks of the curator figure. English-taught lectures cover both theoretical and practical topics that go from the history of contemporary visual arts and practices of exhibition-making, to Exhibition Management. The students will participate in weekly activities, such as artist studio visits, tours of exhibition spaces, networking events and workshops. The program culminates with the set up of the exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School includes visits of specific art venues all over the city of Venice during the 17th International Architecture Venice Biennale. A series of selected case studies will offer the students an opportunity to observe the development of contemporary art. The School‚Äôs goal is to align these specific theoretical lectures with a practical approach. Besides the theoretical lectures, a series of laboratories and workshops aims to introduce the students to the work of critical text writing, press releases and to structure all the different aspects of publishing. The students will be offered the possibility of a gallery training and of setting up together - with one of our tutors, their exhibition in Venice, as a final project of the course.&lt;br/&gt;The first module:&lt;br/&gt;June 3rd ‚Äì August 5th, 2020&lt;br/&gt;The first module involves 350 contact hours:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. History of Curatorial Practices&lt;br/&gt;2. Exhibition Design&lt;br/&gt;3. Aesthetics and Cultural Theory&lt;br/&gt;4. Contemporary Art History&lt;br/&gt;5.

We will visit artist studios and public galleries and Museums of contemporary art. &lt;br/&gt;The second module:&lt;br/&gt;August 17th ‚Äì 21st, 2020&lt;br/&gt;The second module is dedicated to individual researching and finalizing the exhibition project. During this period of time the students will have to face practical duties, such as coordinating the artists, managing transportation and insurance policies, promoting and curating the promotional material. &lt;br/&gt;The third module: &lt;br/&gt;August 24th - September 1st, 2020&lt;br/&gt;The last part of the course lies in the production of the event. During this period of time all the work concerning the final event will take place. The students will coordinate the arrival and the display of the works of art and supervise all the different aspects related to the event, such as promotion, organization, last details about the publication, opening. After the presentation to the public, the student will be given the tools to professionally document the event.&lt;br/&gt;Duration and structure&lt;br/&gt;The course has a duration of 450 hours. The participants will develop themes as well as concepts, organization, acquisition, communication and the concrete implementation of their skills together with the course director and international guests (artists, curators, architects, critics, fine arts scientists and publishers of art journals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application deadline: March, 1st 2020.&lt;br/&gt;The application form must be sent by e-mail before the deadline (March 1st  2020) of the Curatorial Program to:&lt;br/&gt;Xac ‚Äì School for Curatorial Studies&lt;br/&gt;San Marco, 3073, 30124 Venice&lt;br/&gt;Email: curatorialschool@gmail.com&lt;br/&gt;Tel: +39 0412770466&lt;br/&gt;The application form can be downloaded at www.corsocuratori.com, where you can find more information about our curatorial program and your stay in Venice.&lt;br/&gt;The Summer school has a limited number of places available.&lt;br/&gt;Information:&lt;br/&gt;info@corsocuratori.com&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/2934c740-c986-4344-9772-7b36412fc8ca" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>66251374-d227-4de2-9eec-5467144598f9</id><title>12/15 - ACCEPTING CURATORIAL APPLICATIONS | SPRING/BREAK Art Show NYC + Los Angeles 2020</title><updated>2019-12-21T04:28:47.883528+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SPRING/BREAK Art Show&lt;br/&gt;üìç New York, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 12/15/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $150.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.springbreakartshow.com/2020-application/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPRING/BREAK Art Show is accepting submissions by curators until December 15, 2019*, midnight (your time), for the upcoming 2020 New York City and Los Angeles exhibitions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*This is our late application deadline. Regular applications were accepted until November 22, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2020 THEME | IN EXCESS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThe more the merrier.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                          - Traditional&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term ‚Äòtipping point‚Äô is used frequently in current affairs in regards to a variety of topics. Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as ‚Äúcontent‚Äù, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices‚Äô push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world‚Äîpeople to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it‚Ä¶For better or worse, then, the ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of ‚Äòmore‚Äô. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe‚Äîwhere we can find them‚Äîjoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pleasure of ‚Äòmore is more‚Äô may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, ‚Äòthe bigger, brighter, busier, the better‚Äô was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency‚Äîgenerating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul‚Äôs rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff‚Äôs reframing of ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work‚Äù in her P &amp; D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida‚Äôs art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer‚Äôs lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, ‚Äúhow much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can‚Äôt already afford?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People, go for baroque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLICATION GUIDELINES + CURATORIAL REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are separate applications for the New York City and Los Angeles shows. Please note that curators may apply to both the New York City and Los Angeles shows and will need to submit separate applications for each show to be considered for either and/or both. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEADLINES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications will be accepted by independent curators, galleries and non-profit organizations during the late application period between November 23 - December 15, 2019. The online application form will be available during those dates until December 15, 2019 at 11:59pm your time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No proposals nor applications will be accepted via email.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Please note that "Late Applications" are reviewed in the same manner as "Regular Applications". We do not prioritize applications based on when they were submitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APPLICATION FEE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a non-refundable late application fee of $150.00 per application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our mission is to create an unique environment for showcasing independent curators by providing free exhibition space to each selected curator, and therefore, require an application fee to cover our administrative fees for processing the applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO MAY APPLY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) INDEPENDENT CURATORS: Independent Curators may submit an application for the 2020 SPRING/BREAK Art Show, including a curatorial proposal related to the theme of IN EXCESS, sample images of art work, a curatorial statement and additional information necessary to complete the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that an artist may apply as an Independent Curator only if they are applying with a group show or a solo show of another artist's work. An artist may not apply with their own art work in a solo show, but must have a curator who applies on behalf of him/her/they.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is NO FEE for the exhibition space if you are selected as an independent curator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) GALLERIES + PROJECT SPACES + NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS: Applicants affiliated with a gallery or project space/non-profit organization may submit a curatorial proposal comprised of artists from the gallery's roster and this curatorial proposal will fall into our SPECIAL PROJECT section. If you have an affiliation with a gallery, project space or non-profit organization, please define your affiliation/title and include the full roster of artists in the application below for our reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Project section was initiated in 2015 as a way to invite established, new and recently closed galleries to participate in the show. We encourage participants in the Special Project section to explore the theme in full and to go beyond what they typically would do in a traditional art fair environment. In 2019, there were 26 Special Projects as part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Special Project contributes a fee to participate, which helps to cover the production costs of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on applying at an Independent Curator, Gallery or a Non-Profit Organization, please visit our website for more details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.springbreakartshow.com/2020-application/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTED CURATORIAL APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission of an application does not guarantee participation. We will review applications in December and notify selected curators by the beginning of January, if not before. If we have any questions about your proposal, we will contact the primary curator listed on the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each curatorial proposal will be given one (1) room/space for exhibiting artworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected curators will receive a consignment agreement to review and complete. All artworks included in the show must be included in and subject to the terms of the consignment agreement. Artworks that are not listed on the consignment agreement will not be permitted on the show premises. If you have any questions about the consignment terms, please contact us for details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/66251374-d227-4de2-9eec-5467144598f9" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>611e22dc-b446-4a3d-8ef4-22bb23533511</id><title>3/16 - Reflections National Juried Exhibition</title><updated>2019-12-21T04:28:47.883501+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arc Gallery&lt;br/&gt;üìç San Francisco, CA, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 03/16/2020 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $35.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://www.arc-sf.com/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúReflections‚Äù can mean the throwing back of light, sound or images by a body or surface, an image you see when you look in a mirror, an image given back by a reflecting surface.

Regular applications were accepted until November 22, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2020 THEME | IN EXCESS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThe more the merrier.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                          - Traditional&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term ‚Äòtipping point‚Äô is used frequently in current affairs in regards to a variety of topics. Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as ‚Äúcontent‚Äù, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices‚Äô push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world‚Äîpeople to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it‚Ä¶For better or worse, then, the ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of ‚Äòmore‚Äô. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe‚Äîwhere we can find them‚Äîjoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pleasure of ‚Äòmore is more‚Äô may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, ‚Äòthe bigger, brighter, busier, the better‚Äô was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency‚Äîgenerating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul‚Äôs rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff‚Äôs reframing of ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work‚Äù in her P &amp; D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida‚Äôs art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer‚Äôs lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, ‚Äúhow much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can‚Äôt already afford?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People, go for baroque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLICATION GUIDELINES + CURATORIAL REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are separate applications for the New York City and Los Angeles shows. Please note that curators may apply to both the New York City and Los Angeles shows and will need to submit separate applications for each show to be considered for either and/or both. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEADLINES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications will be accepted by independent curators, galleries and non-profit organizations during the late application period between November 23 - December 15, 2019. The online application form will be available during those dates until December 15, 2019 at 11:59pm your time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No proposals nor applications will be accepted via email.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Please note that "Late Applications" are reviewed in the same manner as "Regular Applications". We do not prioritize applications based on when they were submitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APPLICATION FEE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a non-refundable late application fee of $150.00 per application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our mission is to create an unique environment for showcasing independent curators by providing free exhibition space to each selected curator, and therefore, require an application fee to cover our administrative fees for processing the applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO MAY APPLY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) INDEPENDENT CURATORS: Independent Curators may submit an application for the 2020 SPRING/BREAK Art Show, including a curatorial proposal related to the theme of IN EXCESS, sample images of art work, a curatorial statement and additional information necessary to complete the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that an artist may apply as an Independent Curator only if they are applying with a group show or a solo show of another artist's work. An artist may not apply with their own art work in a solo show, but must have a curator who applies on behalf of him/her/they.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is NO FEE for the exhibition space if you are selected as an independent curator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) GALLERIES + PROJECT SPACES + NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS: Applicants affiliated with a gallery or project space/non-profit organization may submit a curatorial proposal comprised of artists from the gallery's roster and this curatorial proposal will fall into our SPECIAL PROJECT section. If you have an affiliation with a gallery, project space or non-profit organization, please define your affiliation/title and include the full roster of artists in the application below for our reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Project section was initiated in 2015 as a way to invite established, new and recently closed galleries to participate in the show. We encourage participants in the Special Project section to explore the theme in full and to go beyond what they typically would do in a traditional art fair environment. In 2019, there were 26 Special Projects as part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Special Project contributes a fee to participate, which helps to cover the production costs of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on applying at an Independent Curator, Gallery or a Non-Profit Organization, please visit our website for more details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.springbreakartshow.com/2020-application/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTED CURATORIAL APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission of an application does not guarantee participation. We will review applications in December and notify selected curators by the beginning of January, if not before. If we have any questions about your proposal, we will contact the primary curator listed on the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each curatorial proposal will be given one (1) room/space for exhibiting artworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected curators will receive a consignment agreement to review and complete. All artworks included in the show must be included in and subject to the terms of the consignment agreement. Artworks that are not listed on the consignment agreement will not be permitted on the show premises. If you have any questions about the consignment terms, please contact us for details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/cb33efad-e6e9-467e-927d-f92d79ae09e6" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
