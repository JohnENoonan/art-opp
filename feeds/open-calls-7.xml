Artists are invited to consider and respond to the following considerations and questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As symbols of Confederate and Colonial power are currently being destroyed, dismantled, reconfigured, or exiled from public view, what new representations should fill their void? What monuments should be created to reflect today‚Äôs values and our desire to project those into the future? Who or what should be given the space, representation, and honor in these new monumental artworks? More specifically, as the reconfiguration of monuments in public space reflects the process of history writing, what histories of New York should be remembered or recovered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kind of monument might shape public consciousness in the creation of civic agents empowered with social and political self-determination? What kind of monument might best to serve and preserve the reclamation of New York‚Äôs underrecognized or repressed histories? How might monument-makers resist the obdurate, authoritarian chauvinist impulses that commonly accompany traditional representational strategies of monuments?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This open call will be the major component of Socrates Sculpture Park‚Äôs year-long engagement with recent discourse on the current state and future of monuments in the United States. It is a thematic adaption of ‚ÄòThe Socrates Annual Fellowship‚Äô and exhibition, and incorporates an extended selection process and production timeline as well as inclusion in an exhibition publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These monument prototypes for New York City will be presented alongside three new commissions for speculative monuments for America by major artists, and a collective monument for Queens created by participants in the Park‚Äôs after-school program for teenagers: Socrateens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellowship recipients will receive a $5,000 production grant to support their project a $1,000 honorarium and four-months of seven-days-a-week access to the resources and fabrication facilities of the Park‚Äôs outdoor artist studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist Fellows are responsible for the fabrication, transportation (if necessary) and installation of their works. Socrates will provide limited technical and installation assistance during a three-week installation period, M-F, 10AM ‚Äì 6PM. Specifics of installation assistance will be discussed with each artist selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT DATES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application Deadline&lt;br/&gt;Monday, November 25, 2019 by 11:59pm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notification&lt;br/&gt;January 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellowship&lt;br/&gt;April 2020 ‚Äì September 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibition&lt;br/&gt;October 2020 ‚Äì March 2021&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOCS TO DOWNLOAD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application Instructions: bit.ly/2NqoZML&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAQs: bit.ly/2PVybKN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment List: bit.ly/2qAeYUc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SITE &amp; CONTEXT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before preparing their applications, artists are strongly encouraged to visit Socrates ‚Äì a unique New York City public park located on the East River waterfront in an industrial area of Long Island City, Queens ‚Äì and to explore Socrates‚Äô website and exhibition archive to learn about the history and context of the organization. Visiting the Park will give applicants a better sense of the factors that effect installations in the Park and help impart insights into the available facilities ‚Äì from the tools and equipment in Socrates‚Äô artist studio to the resources of the surrounding neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REVIEW PROCESS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄòThe Socrates Annual‚Äô fellowship program is based on a competitive, open application process. Completed on-line applications must be submitted by the deadline (Monday, November 25, 2019 by 11:59pm) and will be reviewed by the Socrates exhibition department and outside curatorial advisors. Ten to twelve artists will be selected for the 2020 program. Artists are selected based on the compelling nature of the project proposed, clarity of intent, unique approach to the site, and public context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the recommendations of the curatorial advisors, Socrates staff will contact applicants individually to discuss proposed projects before confirming the final selection in early 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FELLOWSHIP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once accepted, Socrates staff members will meet with each Artist Fellow to discuss project proposals in detail and begin to assist with the development, engineering, and installation of the work. A group meeting for all Artist Fellows and Socrates staff will take place one evening in late winter of 2020, followed by an on-site orientation and individual progress meetings throughout the Fellowship to assess progress, troubleshoot issues, and review next steps. Selected works are subject to final approval by Socrates staff and must meet safety requirements to be able to withstand the effects of weather and public use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellowships are awarded to artists whose careers and artistic practices would benefit from the opportunity.

(Should one be able to afford it‚Ä¶For better or worse, then, the ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of ‚Äòmore‚Äô. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe‚Äîwhere we can find them‚Äîjoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pleasure of ‚Äòmore is more‚Äô may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, ‚Äòthe bigger, brighter, busier, the better‚Äô was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency‚Äîgenerating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul‚Äôs rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff‚Äôs reframing of ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work‚Äù in her P &amp; D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida‚Äôs art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer‚Äôs lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, ‚Äúhow much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can‚Äôt already afford?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People, go for baroque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLICATION GUIDELINES + CURATORIAL REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are separate applications for the New York City and Los Angeles shows.

An artist may not apply with their own art work in a solo show, but must have a curator who applies on behalf of him/her/they.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is NO FEE for the exhibition space if you are selected as an independent curator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) GALLERIES + PROJECT SPACES + NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS: Applicants affiliated with a gallery or project space/non-profit organization may submit a curatorial proposal comprised of artists from the gallery's roster and this curatorial proposal will fall into our SPECIAL PROJECT section. If you have an affiliation with a gallery, project space or non-profit organization, please define your affiliation/title and include the full roster of artists in the application below for our reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Project section was initated in 2015 as a way to invite established, new and recently closed galleries to participate in the show. We encourage participants in the Special Project section to explore the theme in full and to go beyond what they typically would do in a traditional art fair environment. In 2019, there were 26 Special Projects as part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Special Project contributes a fee to participate, which helps to cover the production costs of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on applying at an Independent Curator, Gallery or a Non-Profit Organization, please visit our website for more details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.springbreakartshow.com/2020-application/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTED CURATORIAL APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission of an application does not guarantee participation. We will review applications in December and notify selected curators by the beginning of January, if not before. If we have any questions about your proposal, we will contact the primary curator listed on the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each curatorial proposal will be given one (1) room/space for exhibiting artworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected curators will receive a consignment agreement to review and complete. All artworks included in the show must be included in and subject to the terms of the consignment agreement. Artworks that are not listed on the consignment agreement will not be permitted on the show premises.

Beginning with religious and royal iconography, produced under systems of patronage, portraits were meant to immortalize the divine, powerful, and wealthy. However, what it means to make a portrait ‚Äî its subject, form, method, and medium ‚Äî has expanded beyond those previous confines. There has been a democratization of both subject matter, and practitioners. In reconceptualizing many of the old categories, as well as ushering in a variety of new ones, successive generations of artists have interrogated our received images of race, class, beauty, gender, sexuality. Site:Brooklyn is calling for works, across all mediums, that engage with the increasingly complex intersection between portrait and identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Claire Voon is a freelance arts journalist and critic who lives in Chicago.

Artists have continued to be interested in animals as subject matter. Peaceable Kingdom by Edward Hicks takes its theme from a passage in the bible which tells of the animals gathering together in harmony, Guernica by Picasso tells a story of war, Deborah Butterfield‚Äôs horses are a metaphorical substitute for herself, Louise Bourgeois‚Äô spiders allude to the strength of her mother, and were used as a symbol of nurturing and protection. Animals are of great importance as companions to humans, bringing joy and comfort into our lives. We cherish animals as part of our families, and also consider them our friends and protectors. Animals, insects and even micro-organisms have important roles in the ecosystem, co-existing and balancing each other out. Some animals and insects help to reduce negative impacts on the globe, addressing issues such as global warming and pollution. Animals deserve our respect. Issues around extinction and the care and treatment of animals are of the utmost importance. How are artists incorporating animals into their artwork today? What meaning is placed upon animals and how are animals used as image, symbol and metaphor in artists works today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All media accepted, up to 30-inches, although a few larger works may be considered.&lt;br/&gt;No fee to submit. $40 hanging fee for accepted artists which includes a copy of Drawing Rooms 2019 Yearbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please learn more about the call here and how to submit: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.drawingrooms.org/the-big-show-2019-call.html&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/670f34d1-7077-4d0a-88f2-512f9236c352" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>37afdce1-0425-4ac4-87e8-74c9aa4ad010</id><title>12/31 - Artfare Submissions Program</title><updated>2019-11-20T21:28:04.903428+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Artfare, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;üìç New York, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 12/31/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $20.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://www.artfare.com/for-artists/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artfare is a platform that allows artists and patrons to connect through our iPhone app (artfare.com/app).

Submissions should address themes related to the work of the 2020 Nasher Prize Laureate Michael Rakowitz. This year‚Äôs symposium will be moderated by Dr. Nada Shabout of University of North Texas, founding president of the Association for Modern and Contemporary Art from the Arab World, Iran and Turkey.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium, addresses a broad audience of art historians and museum professionals, allowing symposium participants to receive feedback from fellow presenters, the moderator, the keynote speaker, and audience members. Students selected to present papers will also have their work published in the annual symposium compendium, together with the paper delivered by the keynote speaker, yet to be announced.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since his career began in the late 1990s, Michael Rakowitz‚Äôs dynamic body of work has involved intensive research, resulting in an array of objects, environments, films, and publications that seek to reclaim, reposition, or refocus complicated aspects of material and cultural histories or events. He has especial interest in refugee and migrant populations, particularly from the Middle East. Often durational in nature, his projects frequently enlist the participation of collaborators or the public to create objects or events, making the work as much participatory as it is material.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since 2003, Rakowitz‚Äôs work has considered his own heritage as an American descendent of the Iraqi Jewish diaspora with projects that include, among other efforts, research into the archeological artifacts and sites that have been destroyed or compromised due to political conflict. His ongoing project The invisible enemy should not exist, begun in 2007, seeks to recreate the thousands of artifacts that were looted or destroyed in the raiding of the National Museum of Iraq, Baghdad in 2003, as well as artifacts decimated by ISIS in 2015 during a destructive spree on cultural sites and institutions throughout Iraq. For this, Rakowitz solicits the help of communities of people to remake each of the artifacts, at their original scale, using images and information from the University of Chicago‚Äôs Oriental Institute database. Employing packaging from Middle Eastern food products and Arabic newspapers in combination with simple sculptural means, such as papier-m√¢ch√©, the ancient objects are recreated as colorful, text- and image-laden sculptures that the artist has described as ‚Äúghosts‚Äù.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Suggested Topics for the 2020 Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium:&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìProvisional architecture within sculpture&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìArchaeology and the politics of cultural heritage&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìFood in social practice and community-healing&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìTraditional sculptural methods in contemporary sculptural practice&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìTransmissions of skill or expertise as forms of resistance to cultural erasure&lt;br/&gt;- Social media and e-commerce sites as paths of research&lt;br/&gt;- Artistic responses to the destruction of cultural patrimony&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Complete proposals must include the following:&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìContact information, participant‚Äôs field and university affiliation, and CV&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄìPaper title and abstract of no more than 200 words, and 3 to 5 keywords&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposals are due by Sunday, December 15, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;Send submissions and questions to symposium@nashersculpturecenter.org&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We hope to notify successful applicants by January 13, 2020.
