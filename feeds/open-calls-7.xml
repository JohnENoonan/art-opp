All submissions should use at least one of NYC‚Äôs open datasets, available through Open Data Portal.

Digital twins ‚Äî avatars, simulation models and artificial intelligence ‚Äî constitute virtual worlds which can be used to both interpret and shape our reality. How are individuals, societies, cities and natural systems reflected in and impacted by digital worldbuilding? How can they help us better understand ourselves and our reality? On the other hand, how can implicit or explicit bias distort or mislead such efforts, and what are the consequences when we lose control of these digital worlds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of Data through Design and Open Data Week, a city-wide endeavor by the NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office of Data Analytics, is to encourage a wider knowledge of New York City‚Äôs open datasets and how these resources can enable better public understanding of what is happening in NYC‚Äôs neighborhoods, schools, streets, and parks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deadline to submit a proposal is January 20th.

From the Neolithic period onwards, textiles, metals, glass, stone, and other materials were laboriously and carefully woven into images and figures, marking the intersecting and complex paths of commerce, religious and domestic life, and the arts. The Industrial Revolution begin the mass manufacture of textiles, making them available to ever larger swaths of society. These materials and methods have been increasingly integrated into the fine arts, creating a flourishing and exciting conjunction. What is the place, and future of craft in contemporary art? Site:Brooklyn is looking to answer this question, with works that range across all styles and mediums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Juror:&lt;br/&gt;Samantha De Tillio is a curator and writer specializing in modern and contemporary craft. She is Assistant Curator at the Museum of Arts and Design, where her upcoming exhibition Beth Lipman: Collective Elegy (May 14, 2020 to March 28, 2021) is the artist‚Äôs first midcareer survey. She is also a Contributing Editor for GLASS: The UrbanGlass Art Quarterly and her ongoing personal research includes the first in-depth study of the life and fiber sculpture of Dorian Zachai (1932-2015). She has worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, and the Albany Institute of History and Art in various curatorial and research capacities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Gallery:&lt;br/&gt;Site:Brooklyn Gallery located in Brooklyn, New York is dedicated to exhibiting the current practice of contemporary artists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dates:&lt;br/&gt;Call Announcement: December 13, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Final Submission Deadline: February 3, 2020 11:59 PM MT&lt;br/&gt;Notification Letter: February 12, 2020&lt;br/&gt;Gallery Exhibition: March 20, 2019‚Äì April 18, 2020&lt;br/&gt;Opening Reception: Friday, March 13, 2019 from 6-9 PM&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Eligibility:&lt;br/&gt;This is a juried exhibition for artists working in drawing across all mediums.
