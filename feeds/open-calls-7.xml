The objective is to provide quality real work experiences and mentorship for women identifying graduate/pre/post-doc students and emerging professionals from backgrounds generally underrepresented in the field to aid their transition from academic to professional careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through one-on-one mentoring relationships with ArtTable members, every year, a selected number of fellows have the opportunity to work with an established leader in the field and gain exposure to a range of professional activities at first class cultural institutions throughout a five to eight week period during the summer. Each fellow will be connected with an ArtTable 'mentor' for the duration of their fellowship and be awarded a $4,000 stipend for the five to eight-week commitment during the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program was established in 2000 as a conscious effort to enrich and strengthen the visual arts field by supporting an inclusive and diverse professional landscape. The ArtTable Fellowship is one of the longest-standing programs supporting diversity in the visual arts. The mentored fellowships introduce emerging women-identifying professionals to the range of professional career tracks in the visual arts, including but not limited to: curatorial, education, public programming, archival research and collections management.

The DTour is part of Fermentation Fest - A Live Culture Convergence including classes, workshops, and art events celebrating live culture in all its forms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wormfarm Institute will commission 6-8 original Art Works to be installed along the DTour route. The work will be on public view from September 25-October 4, 2020. We seek artists (individuals or teams) who are interested in creating site-responsive works that engage with the agricultural landscape, the farmers, landowners, and surrounding rural communities. This is an opportunity to contribute to a unique and exciting project with an established reputation for its innovative approach to creative placemaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We seek to curate a diverse group of artists for projects that respond to the land on the edge of Wisconsin‚Äôs Driftless Region. Successful past projects have ranged from fixed objects, to interactive environments, to work activated by natural processes. Some have invited hands-on participation, utilized existing agricultural infrastructure, or were installed in/on buildings in the small towns along the route. The viewers (DTourists) are usually traveling by car and guided by a map, so proposals should be large-scale and visually compelling. Artists are responsible for both installation and de-installation (volunteer assistance possible) and will have about two weeks to install and one week to de-install. Unless other arrangements are made, artists retain ownership of the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has been supported by The National Endowment for the Arts, Wisconsin Arts Board, ArtPlace America, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and The Educational Foundation of America. The Wormfarm Institute, the event‚Äôs presenter, is an award-winning non-profit organization with the mission to integrate culture and agriculture along the rural/urban continuum. This will be the 8th year of the DTour (now a biennial) and the first year along a new route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUDGET&lt;br/&gt;Wormfarm will fund projects at two levels: $5,000 and $2,500. Six to eight proposals will be selected from a combination of funding levels. Please indicate on your application which funding level you are applying for. &lt;br/&gt;An itemized budget is not required for Phase One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VISION: ‚ÄúArt Amplifies what landscape quietly asserts‚Äù - Max Garland, past Wisconsin Poet Laureate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, which began as a celebration of food, farming and rural life, has revealed itself to be a powerful tool for bringing people together across perceived divides. Rooted in an arts and culture focus, we emphasize the cross-sector collaboration necessary to build a vibrant region that values both its rural and urban parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ecology there is a concept called "edge environments‚Äù ‚Äì areas between one sort of landscape and another, where ecosystems overlap. These edges tend to have more diversity (and therefore more hardiness) than either of the adjoining environments alone. These mixed-use zones, both literal and conceptual, characterize the DTour experience and allow us to see new possibilities for our land, our work, and our communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DTour is an invitation for people, both rural and urban dwellers, to follow a path and take a closer look at a rural community and landscape where farming plays a central though changing role. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTION PROCESS&lt;br/&gt;Artists will be chosen to participate through a two-part selection process. Initial proposals will be reviewed by a jury consisting of the organizers, past DTour artists, and regional and national arts professionals. Up to 15 finalists will be selected and notified by March 30. Finalists will be expected to attend a two-day Orientation in Sauk County, WI in May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orientation aims to deepen the participants‚Äô understanding of the event, the landscape, the current state of agriculture as well as provide an opportunity for artists to meet with event organizers, landowners, past DTour artists, and one another. The weekend will include a tour of the DTour route, shared meals, and ample opportunity to share ideas and ask questions. Meals and housing will be provided. It is our hope that this experience has value independent of being selected for this year. Participants will receive a stipend to help cover travel expenses and subsequently develop a full proposal. Afterwards, finalists will have two weeks to develop a full proposal.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTION CRITERIA&lt;br/&gt;- Artistic excellence&lt;br/&gt;- Visual Impact&lt;br/&gt;- Demonstrated ability to realize&lt;br/&gt;- Community Engagement&lt;br/&gt;- Feasibility in the context of the larger event&lt;br/&gt;- Curatorial vision&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;Please respond with: &lt;br/&gt;- One page Letter of Interest including contact information &lt;br/&gt;- Preliminary Project Concept indicating funding level, not to exceed one page &lt;br/&gt;- Concept drawings or visual references &lt;br/&gt;- 8-10 images of applicant‚Äôs recent work demonstrating capacity to realize large-scale outdoor project &lt;br/&gt;- Resume or C.V. not to exceed two pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Format:&lt;br/&gt;- Letter of Interest, Project Concept, Drawings, Resume/C.V. should be saved as a single PDF or Word doc.&lt;br/&gt;- Images must be JPEG format, ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúfine‚Äù quality, not to exceed 2 MB per image. &lt;br/&gt;- Image file names should include artist‚Äôs last name and be numbered: ‚ÄúSmith-01.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to keep in mind when developing your proposal:&lt;br/&gt;- Wisconsin weather can be unpredictable, plan for rain, cold &amp; high winds.&lt;br/&gt;- The landscape can dwarf even the most ambitious projects.&lt;br/&gt;- DTour audience interaction ranges from drive-by to direct engagement with installations. Keep both scenarios in mind as you develop your idea.&lt;br/&gt;- The DTour runs primarily along farm fields, but also includes woods, wetlands, and small towns. Most sites however, will be located in hay fields or pasture.&lt;br/&gt;- The DTour is expected to attract 20,000-30,000 people from near and far. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TIMELINE  &lt;br/&gt;March 10:  Email Applications due by 5 p.m. CST   &lt;br/&gt;March 30:  Finalists selected, notification sent to applicants&lt;br/&gt;May 2-3:  Finalist Orientation in Sauk County, WI &lt;br/&gt;May 20:  Final Proposals due&lt;br/&gt;June 1:  Artists chosen, notified&lt;br/&gt;June: Contracts with selected artists, final site selection &lt;br/&gt;September 11- 23: Installation of Art Work&lt;br/&gt;Sept 25 ‚Äì Oct 4: Farm/Art DTour + Fermentation Fest&lt;br/&gt;October 5 ‚Äì 19: De-installation of work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email application to info@wormfarminstitute.org by March 10, 5 p.m. CST.

In keeping with the theme of Woman‚Äôs History Month, the focus is mainly feminist-centric, but, the call also seeks to include works that highlight adjacent movements and concerns to those of women and feminism, which notably have a history of engaging in self-examination. Artists and creatives, individual or collective, of all genders, nationalities, and mediums- visual arts, video, sound art, text, and poetry are encouraged to apply.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;During this very uncertain time of increasing divisiveness in the country and the world, the remembrance of the Suffragette Movement could serve as a cautionary tale on the struggle and preservation of human rights. The Nineteenth Amendment all too frequently is viewed only &lt;br/&gt;in its decisive moment of victory, a fait accompli, glossing over its problematic and arduous progression towards ratification and the current day disenfranchisement and oppression that continue to threaten many here and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than striking with defensive declarations of -We Are- that flatten conversation and knowledge, this exhibition looks to the heart of our cultural and political clashes where the question of -Who are We- resides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists are in a unique position to ask this question through their work; politics in art is not limited merely to statement-making. Art offers us the opportunity to explore how we understand and apprehend our worlds, the manifold methods of communication that may reveal otherwise untold perceptions, and exposure of a creative process the vulnerability of which is an invitation to the shared meanings that are the underpinnings of every society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply please copy and paste the below link into your browser or visit us at www.licartists.org for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://licartists.formstack.com/forms/submission_form_social_transformation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the curator:&lt;br/&gt;Lisa di Donato received her BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design.

This program will feature a total of 4 exhibitions, from May 2020- January 2021. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space that is open for showcasing in the duration listed is the western-facing windows-- the triangular window space on the corner of Rockwell and Fulton and the large windows that are parallel to Rockwell Place. The exhibition proposal must prioritize the viewpoint from the street looking into the windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideal proposals will include consideration of the unique opportunity for visibility 24/7 in this public- facing space. UrbanGlass is seeking proposals that clearly showcases plans for how the artist plans to use the windows explicitly. Please be sure to explicitly describe your use of the space and how your work will be viewed from Fulton and Rockwell Street. Your plans should be bold and visible from the street view and consider the nature of this space. The majority of viewers seeing your exhibition will interface with the installation from the street-view, and not by walking into the gallery.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications can include proposals for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installations. &lt;br/&gt;An installation of artwork that is representative of work being made in the contemporary glass community. The proposed works can be a combination of glass and mixed media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performances.&lt;br/&gt;Performances using handmade glass, scheduled for the opening nights of exhibitions of AVAC and possibly additional times that include high foot-traffic hours for the Rockwell and Fulton corner. If this format is proposed, this must include a plan for artwork that is also installed permanently in the space while the artist is not present. Note: open flame is not allowed in this space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Window Residencies. &lt;br/&gt;Artists may propose an activation project. This can include being present in the Window Gallery during certain hours to showcase their making process or other interactive opportunities for visitors to UrbanGlass. The artist must include in their proposal an explanation of what artwork will be installed permanently in the space while the artist is not present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To apply, please submit: a proposal, your resume or CV, exhibition design using the Window Gallery map below, exhibition budget draft, 5 images, and an image list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details of materials for applications:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal, one page long in PDF format, that outlines your intent for an exhibition in the Window Gallery. Maximum of 800 words. Please include your preference, for an opening date for an exhibition in 2020: May 2020, July 2020, September 2020, November 2020. Each exhibition is scheduled to run for approximately 2 months. Typically UrbanGlass hosts an opening reception on the opening week of the show. &lt;br/&gt;Resume or CV, one page long, PDF format, which lists your involvement at UrbanGlass (If applicable). Maximum of 500 words. &lt;br/&gt;A draft of the exhibition you have in mind and how it will be laid out in the space. Feel free to use the Window Gallery map below to draw/ design how you plan to utilize this space. UrbanGlass understands if this design shifts slightly from your original plan, but any dramatic shifts from the originally proposed exhibition design must be approved by UrbanGlass staff. &lt;br/&gt;Exhibition budget draft, which includes how you plan to use the honorarium included with this opportunity. &lt;br/&gt;5 images that represent your proposal and showcases the work that you intend to show in the Window Gallery. Images must be in JPG format and be 300 DPI. Maximum size of 6 inches in height and width. Each image should be a maximum of 8M each. Label each image with your last name and the number in the order in which you would like the image to be viewed. Example: Smith_01.jpg.&lt;br/&gt;Image List, in PDF format, which includes: title, size, date, and materials. &lt;br/&gt;Artists who have shown in the Window Gallery previous to 2017, can apply for this opportunity with new work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Please consider printing out your materials as a test-run before submitting them, to make sure that the application easily prints from any computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists will receive a stipend of $500 to use for all supplies needed, including hardware, to install artwork in the space. Artists are responsible for both installation and de-installation of Window Gallery exhibitions. This includes wall repair during de-installation, i.e., patching and sanding of any holes or blemishes created by the artist. If you need assistance in installing or de-installing the work, please consider including the expense of an art handler in your exhibition budget draft. Because the gallery staff is so small, they are unable to dedicate time to assist in this part of the process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists whose exhibitions are selected for this exhibition opportunity are asked to provide the following 3 months prior to the opening of their show in the space: 3-4 images of works in the show, a brief artist bio, exhibition essay (max 800 words), and a final budget draft. 1 month prior to the exhibition opening artists submit a completed loan agreement and title list (with insurance values). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission deadline: Wednesday, January 22, 2020 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to apply: Send and email to opportunities@urbanglass.org with the subject line "2020 Window Gallery Application." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposals are evaluated by a panel of artists and curators.

It corresponds with the 10-year anniversary of the original Brooklyn Utopias? exhibitions series developed by curator Katherine Gressel and presented at Old Stone House (OSH) among other sites in 2009-2010. At a time of reflection on the past decade, OSH invites artists to explore how Brooklyn has continued to change over the past 10 years, and if/how it can serve as a model for urban and American living on a national scale, especially in the months leading up to the 2020 election. Brooklyn Utopias also addresses the possibilities (or limitations) of art in creating a better world. We welcome submissions from artists based in or exploring issues in our surrounding Gowanus/Park Slope/Sunset Park area, as well as a range of diverse Brooklyn neighborhoods. In addition to an August opening reception, we plan to host a closing event during the annual Gowanus Open Studios, October 15, 16 or 17, focused on the future of the arts in this neighborhood. As with all our exhibitions, we also encourage projects that engage with our unique history and space; this exhibition will be featured in our annual Battle Week events calendar celebrating the anniversary of the Revolutionary War Battle of Brooklyn, which took place on OSH grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please visit the open call link on our website for more information on the the Brooklyn Utopias series, as well as our history and exhibition space: &lt;a href="https://theoldstonehouse.org/event/call-for-submissions-brooklyn-utopias-2020/2020-01-15/" target="_blank"&gt;https://theoldstonehouse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects in all media are welcome (though see ‚Äúexhibit specifications‚Äù on our website for specific requirements). As in the past, we are also interested in commissioning public art for the surrounding Washington Park, and artwork created with the participation of local community groups or schools‚Äìplease contact OSH in advance if you‚Äôd like us to help try to match you with a community partner organization.  We are also open to temporary indoor or outdoor event proposals that engage with this theme, from both artists and community organizations. Artists are especially encouraged to propose community workshops that complement artwork on view in the gallery (as opposed to stand-alone events). Due to OSH‚Äôs busy event calendar, public programs will be arranged at mutually convenient times, based on OSH‚Äôs availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO SUBMIT ‚Äì &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please email the following to Katherine Gressel, curator at  katherinegressel@gmail.com, by 11:59 PST on March 1, 2020 with the email subject line ‚ÄúBrooklyn Utopias Submission‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.
