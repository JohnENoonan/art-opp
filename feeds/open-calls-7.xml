This program will feature a total of 4 exhibitions, from May 2020- January 2021. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space that is open for showcasing in the duration listed is the western-facing windows-- the triangular window space on the corner of Rockwell and Fulton and the large windows that are parallel to Rockwell Place. The exhibition proposal must prioritize the viewpoint from the street looking into the windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideal proposals will include consideration of the unique opportunity for visibility 24/7 in this public- facing space. UrbanGlass is seeking proposals that clearly showcases plans for how the artist plans to use the windows explicitly. Please be sure to explicitly describe your use of the space and how your work will be viewed from Fulton and Rockwell Street. Your plans should be bold and visible from the street view and consider the nature of this space. The majority of viewers seeing your exhibition will interface with the installation from the street-view, and not by walking into the gallery.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications can include proposals for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installations. &lt;br/&gt;An installation of artwork that is representative of work being made in the contemporary glass community. The proposed works can be a combination of glass and mixed media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performances.&lt;br/&gt;Performances using handmade glass, scheduled for the opening nights of exhibitions of AVAC and possibly additional times that include high foot-traffic hours for the Rockwell and Fulton corner. If this format is proposed, this must include a plan for artwork that is also installed permanently in the space while the artist is not present. Note: open flame is not allowed in this space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Window Residencies. &lt;br/&gt;Artists may propose an activation project. This can include being present in the Window Gallery during certain hours to showcase their making process or other interactive opportunities for visitors to UrbanGlass. The artist must include in their proposal an explanation of what artwork will be installed permanently in the space while the artist is not present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To apply, please submit: a proposal, your resume or CV, exhibition design using the Window Gallery map below, exhibition budget draft, 5 images, and an image list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details of materials for applications:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal, one page long in PDF format, that outlines your intent for an exhibition in the Window Gallery. Maximum of 800 words. Please include your preference, for an opening date for an exhibition in 2020: May 2020, July 2020, September 2020, November 2020. Each exhibition is scheduled to run for approximately 2 months. Typically UrbanGlass hosts an opening reception on the opening week of the show. &lt;br/&gt;Resume or CV, one page long, PDF format, which lists your involvement at UrbanGlass (If applicable). Maximum of 500 words. &lt;br/&gt;A draft of the exhibition you have in mind and how it will be laid out in the space. Feel free to use the Window Gallery map below to draw/ design how you plan to utilize this space. UrbanGlass understands if this design shifts slightly from your original plan, but any dramatic shifts from the originally proposed exhibition design must be approved by UrbanGlass staff. &lt;br/&gt;Exhibition budget draft, which includes how you plan to use the honorarium included with this opportunity. &lt;br/&gt;5 images that represent your proposal and showcases the work that you intend to show in the Window Gallery. Images must be in JPG format and be 300 DPI. Maximum size of 6 inches in height and width. Each image should be a maximum of 8M each. Label each image with your last name and the number in the order in which you would like the image to be viewed.

Artists are responsible for both installation and de-installation of Window Gallery exhibitions. This includes wall repair during de-installation, i.e., patching and sanding of any holes or blemishes created by the artist. If you need assistance in installing or de-installing the work, please consider including the expense of an art handler in your exhibition budget draft. Because the gallery staff is so small, they are unable to dedicate time to assist in this part of the process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists whose exhibitions are selected for this exhibition opportunity are asked to provide the following 3 months prior to the opening of their show in the space: 3-4 images of works in the show, a brief artist bio, exhibition essay (max 800 words), and a final budget draft. 1 month prior to the exhibition opening artists submit a completed loan agreement and title list (with insurance values). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission deadline: Wednesday, January 22, 2020 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to apply: Send and email to opportunities@urbanglass.org with the subject line "2020 Window Gallery Application." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposals are evaluated by a panel of artists and curators.

It corresponds with the 10-year anniversary of the original Brooklyn Utopias? exhibitions series developed by curator Katherine Gressel and presented at Old Stone House (OSH) among other sites in 2009-2010. At a time of reflection on the past decade, OSH invites artists to explore how Brooklyn has continued to change over the past 10 years, and if/how it can serve as a model for urban and American living on a national scale, especially in the months leading up to the 2020 election. Brooklyn Utopias also addresses the possibilities (or limitations) of art in creating a better world. We welcome submissions from artists based in or exploring issues in our surrounding Gowanus/Park Slope/Sunset Park area, as well as a range of diverse Brooklyn neighborhoods. In addition to an August opening reception, we plan to host a closing event during the annual Gowanus Open Studios, October 15, 16 or 17, focused on the future of the arts in this neighborhood. As with all our exhibitions, we also encourage projects that engage with our unique history and space; this exhibition will be featured in our annual Battle Week events calendar celebrating the anniversary of the Revolutionary War Battle of Brooklyn, which took place on OSH grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please visit the open call link on our website for more information on the the Brooklyn Utopias series, as well as our history and exhibition space: &lt;a href="https://theoldstonehouse.org/event/call-for-submissions-brooklyn-utopias-2020/2020-01-15/" target="_blank"&gt;https://theoldstonehouse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects in all media are welcome (though see ‚Äúexhibit specifications‚Äù on our website for specific requirements). As in the past, we are also interested in commissioning public art for the surrounding Washington Park, and artwork created with the participation of local community groups or schools‚Äìplease contact OSH in advance if you‚Äôd like us to help try to match you with a community partner organization.  We are also open to temporary indoor or outdoor event proposals that engage with this theme, from both artists and community organizations. Artists are especially encouraged to propose community workshops that complement artwork on view in the gallery (as opposed to stand-alone events). Due to OSH‚Äôs busy event calendar, public programs will be arranged at mutually convenient times, based on OSH‚Äôs availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO SUBMIT ‚Äì &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please email the following to Katherine Gressel, curator at  katherinegressel@gmail.com, by 11:59 PST on March 1, 2020 with the email subject line ‚ÄúBrooklyn Utopias Submission‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.

Digital twins ‚Äî avatars, simulation models and artificial intelligence ‚Äî constitute virtual worlds which can be used to both interpret and shape our reality. How are individuals, societies, cities and natural systems reflected in and impacted by digital worldbuilding? How can they help us better understand ourselves and our reality? On the other hand, how can implicit or explicit bias distort or mislead such efforts, and what are the consequences when we lose control of these digital worlds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of Data through Design and Open Data Week, a city-wide endeavor by the NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office of Data Analytics, is to encourage a wider knowledge of New York City‚Äôs open datasets and how these resources can enable better public understanding of what is happening in NYC‚Äôs neighborhoods, schools, streets, and parks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deadline to submit a proposal is January 20th. Selected artists will be announced by January 27th, and must have their works ready for installation by February 27th. The exhibit will run from February 28th (opening reception) through March 7th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please submit your proposals here: &lt;br/&gt;https://forms.gle/7nz8pSw7rWChgRaw9&lt;br/&gt;In addition to filling out the form at the link above, please attach the following (upload through the form):&lt;br/&gt;   - A maximum 2-page sketch detailing your idea, its size dimensions, and contextual information for your proposal &lt;br/&gt;   - Your Digital portfolio (either website or PDF)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The format of submissions is flexible.
