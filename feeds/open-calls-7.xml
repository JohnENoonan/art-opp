FringeArts received a New Audiences New Places grant from the William Penn Foundation in the spring of 2018. This grant, titled Fringe Populi: Building Audiences through Public Performance, seeks to ‚Äúbuild new audiences through large-scale public practice works [that] generate both wide attention through scale, spectacle, and resonance of content,‚Äù and that provide ‚Äúmore focused, deeper engagement with individuals recruited to participate in the work.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous examples of public practice pieces stewarded by FringeArts include Le Grand Continental (2012, Sylvain √âmard), 100% Philadelphia (2014, Rimini Protokoll), Gala (2016, Jer√¥me Bel), Le Super Grand Continental (2018, Sylvain √âmard), and √öumbal: Nomadic Choreography for Inhabitants (2019, Mariana Arteaga). The 2020 Fringe Populi piece will be the culminating performance in the Fringe Populi New Audiences New Places grant that aims to break down perception barriers which keep the Philadelphia public from engaging in contemporary performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Artist‚Äôs piece should aim to engage between 100-250 performers at varying levels of engagement and commitment. Artist proposals will provide a clear outline of project dramaturgy, recruitment, rehearsal structure, and performance. The priorities of the Fringe Populi project are to cultivate wide encounters of contemporary performance with the Philadelphia public, present work that is free and outdoors, and to engage with civically-activated spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal applications open on Monday, September 9th and are due back to FringeArts by 5:00pm on Monday, October 7th. Please read the Fringe Populi Requirements and Guidelines closely before starting your application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To apply, please fill out this form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions?

Residents explore the possibilities of prints, publications, or multiples, and have the time to develop a focused project on a variety of cutting edge and traditional print equipment with the assistance of Paper Machine staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOOKS: &lt;br/&gt;DEADLINE: 10/17&lt;br/&gt;FEE: $20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antenna publishes new Comic Books, Chapbooks, or Guidebooks, all through open call processes.

This selection will be done by a panel of esteemed judges with cultural and artistic significance in New York City and beyond to bring further awareness to this important cause and uplift the burgeoning talent it threatens to stifle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time has come to expose the corruptness of the student loan system in the United States. Damaged Art has an agenda to unveil the scandalous nature that loan companies have used to unknowingly sign students up for a lifetime fairytale deal with the devil. Many students have no choice but to sign up for loans that lead to enormous interest rates, monthly payments that are akin to extortion, and constant harassment that threatens their livelihood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damaged Art is an exhibit conceived and curated by New York artist, Cheryl Georgette. For years she has assisted fine artist Vera Lutter in New York City and Los Angeles, in which she was an artist and resident at LACMA. Prior to working as an assistant, she worked various positions in the photography and art industry: Ruby Bird Studio, Gowanus Darkroom, The Studio at the Darkroom, Alt Citizen, and Animazing Gallery. The exhibit will focus on New York artists, but has plans to expand to other cities nationwide to continue bringing awareness to young talent and the hardships they face in order to be able to create. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damaged Art is a submission based art show. Open call is Sept 17-Oct 9. The exhibition will be held at lower east side gallery, 98 Orchard on November 8-10. Stay tuned for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply for the exhibition, click on the "Apply Now" button on the Damaged Art website. www.damaged-art.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artwork submitted to DAMAGED ART for the exhibition must be unique works by the artist, no limited editions will be accepted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists may submit 1 - 3 works of art for consideration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Must Submit Artist Statement and Student Loan Story: Please provide a paragraph, no longer than 200 words, of your personal journey with student loan debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must provide an estimated amount of your entire student loan debt: a combination of federal and private loans. Personal loans do not apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submit website and/or social media links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAMAGED ART will notify you by October 21st if your work is accepted in the exhibition. We may request to see additional work, or ask that you elaborate on your story, if necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selection process will be determined by esteemed Judges, the week of October 14, 2019. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Announcement of accepted artists is Monday, October 21, 2019. Accepted artists then MUST provide verification of the amount of their TOTAL student loan debt: including federal, private and any loans in default. Prove your student loan debt amount by sending current statements, and DAMAGED ART will determine the price of your artwork, factoring in an interest that may accrue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If accepted into the exhibition, we will require that you verify your student loan debt. It is understandable that your estimated student loan amount submitted for the Open Call may differ to the actual owed debt. Please do not let that discourage showing us the actual amount owed. The exhibition‚Äôs purpose is to pull off the bandaid, and show and tell your financial story. You are not alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student Loan Debt accrued from personal loan borrowing need not apply. I apologize for this, but as this is the 1st Damaged Art Exhibition, it is best to keep to legal contracts at this time. If part of your student loan debt was covered through personal reasons, please define that amount in the application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please see Terms &amp; Conditions on website&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/984856bb-a06b-43c1-ba29-2b51c7ad6116" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>6d925571-3770-46d9-97a6-7c8d0d4b1b8f</id><title>10/10 - 10th Annual Manifest Prize: $5,000 Cash Award</title><updated>2019-10-08T13:27:02.755433+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Manifest Creative Research Gallery and Drawing Center&lt;br/&gt;üìç Cincinnati, OH, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Disciplines&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 10/10/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $40.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cincinnati based non-profit arts organization and gallery, Manifest, invites visual artists to submit works of any media, any genre/style, any size.

This expanded definition included mark-making that ventured off the paper, into multimedia, film, sculpture and much else. However, in recent years, many artists have returned to a more gestural and representational mode. In this new and dynamic tension between tradition and experimental visions, Site:Brooklyn is looking for works, across all mediums and processes, which showcase the diversity and range of drawing‚Äôs place in contemporary art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Olga Valle Tetkowski is currently deputy director at The Drawing Center in NYC.

Throughout the canon of art history, the human figure has been a central theme, as we grapple with our own existence, feeding a desire to self represent and to understand our place in the universe. This exhibition will present works by contemporary artists who address the figure not just as an object of beauty, or a subject of anatomy, but rather elaborate on contemporary themes of body positive depictions of the human form, including all body types, ages and genders, celebrating diversity as well as the timeless beauty of the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Body Positivity? The body-positive movement, which dates back to early Victorian reforms against the corset, 1960‚Äôs initiatives against fat-shaming, and more recently via social media with influencers challenging unrealistic standards of beauty, is ‚Äúrooted in the belief that all human beings should have a positive body image, while challenging the ways in which society presents and views the physical body. The goal of the movement is to address unrealistic beauty standards and to build the confidence of oneself and others. The movement sets forth the notion that beauty is a construct of society, and poses that this construct should not infringe upon one's ability to feel confidence or self-worth. The movement states that neither fat-shaming nor skinny-shaming is acceptable, and that all body types can and should be celebrated.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ‚ÄúBody Beautiful‚Äù exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works will be considered in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, and performance amongst others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group show will take place at The Untitled Space gallery in Tribeca, New York, as well as online on Artsy. The exhibit is open to submissions until September 30, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE&lt;br/&gt;The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street.

As such, we seek to provide alternative exhibition platforms to the vast network of independent curators who offer new ways of seeing, understanding, and experiencing artists and their works. The program creates an opportunity for a curator to realize an exhibition concept and bring it to the public in Detroit. The selected curator will demonstrate in their proposal a level of engagement and thoughtfulness about how their exhibition engages with the local city and community, and why it should take place in Detroit. Red Bull Arts Detroit will support the curator in the execution of the exhibition and its public programming. The exhibition will open in July of 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curator receives access to our 12,000 square foot gallery for their exhibition as well as financial, production, and marketing support to execute their vision. For Detroit-based curators, the fellowship will provide travel and accommodation for five trips for planning purposes outside of the city in advance of the exhibition. For non-Detroit based curators, Red Bull Arts Detroit will provide travel for three trips to Detroit in advance of the exhibition for planning purposes, three-trips to Detroit during the exhibition for programming purposes, and accommodations in Detroit during visits. The selected curator will receive a $5000 fee. The budget for the production of the exhibition is $15,000 along with funding for three-to-four public programs. Outside of the $15,000, Red Bull Arts Detroit will provide in-kind support that includes local installation staff, staffing for gallery hours, access to technology for use in exhibition (list of available technology is at - &lt;a href="http://redbullarts.com/detroit/exhibition-equipment-and-technology/" target="_blank"&gt;http://redbullarts.com&lt;/a&gt;), printing wall texts (labels and vinyl) as well as gallery guides, and installation documentation of the exhibition. The curator should plan for the $15,000 exhibition budget to cover any artist fees, production fees for works or installation materials, artist travel, shipping and handling of art works, commissioning of new writing or texts, and any other materials or labor otherwise required for the production of their exhibition concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Guidelines&lt;br/&gt;- The Red Bull Arts Detroit Curatorial Fellowship takes place once a year&lt;br/&gt;- Applications are open August 19th ‚Äì September 30th, 2019, with selected projects presented in July of 2020.&lt;br/&gt;- Applicants should regularly curate contemporary art exhibitions, drawing from the disciplines of visual, sound, or performance art.&lt;br/&gt;- Applicants must submit a CV, Statement of Purpose, and project proposal.

Bidders are encouraged to develop their own understanding of the context of her life and her achievements. The key objectives are to create a lasting tribute to Rosalie Gardiner Jones that is integrated with the Cold Spring Harbor State Park site and utilizes materials that are durable and require minimal maintenance and care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jones was an outspoken advocate for woman‚Äôs suffrage, most often on the grass roots level. She not only&lt;br/&gt;travelled across Long Island with her yellow ‚ÄúSuffrage Wagon,‚Äù she also campaigned for women‚Äôs suffrage&lt;br/&gt;in New York City, Washington, DC, and across the country. Most famously, she led a ‚Äúhike‚Äù from the Bronx&lt;br/&gt;to Albany in December 1912 to present a petition to the newly elected governor urging that women be given&lt;br/&gt;the right to vote. Two months later, ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù Jones led her ‚ÄúArmy of the Hudson‚Äù on another march or&lt;br/&gt;‚Äúpilgrimage‚Äù from Newark, New Jersey, to Washington, DC, to participate in the famous suffrage parade on&lt;br/&gt;the eve of Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs inauguration. Jones and her followers wore long brown pilgrim capes for this&lt;br/&gt;march and their second hike up the west side of the Hudson to Albany in 1914. These marches gained extensive publicity for the suffrage cause in newspapers throughout the country and resulted in General&lt;br/&gt;Jones becoming a national celebrity. She spoke for suffrage in Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, and&lt;br/&gt;New Jersey. Jones also led parades on Long Island, flew over Staten Island in a bi-plane dropping suffrage&lt;br/&gt;leaflets, and campaigned throughout New York State in a yellow suffrage automobile, spreading the gospel&lt;br/&gt;of Votes for Women. Jones was born in New York City, but spent much of her life in the family mansion on&lt;br/&gt;the west side of Cold Spring Harbor, opposite what is now Cold Spring Harbor State Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monument to memorialize ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù Jones should engage the public. It should communicate the&lt;br/&gt;strength and courage exhibited by Jones as she endeavored to make women‚Äôs suffrage a reality through its&lt;br/&gt;materiality, its form and its setting. The proposed monument should consider the terrain and underground&lt;br/&gt;structures, flora and fauna at the site, as well as views and access to the street, parking lots, and waterfront.&lt;br/&gt;The design of the site should welcome visitors to linger near the artwork to contemplate women‚Äôs suffrage&lt;br/&gt;and equal rights for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please apply through the New York State Contract Reporter website:  &lt;a href="http://www.nyscr.ny.gov/adsOpen.cfm?ID=77B04B69-54CD-48B7-A966-053D540DDB16." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nyscr.ny.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An optional, but highly recommended, site visit is scheduled for October 8, 2019, at 1pm.

Individuals, communities, political subcultures, social media spheres, even whole countries are each, it would seem, a ticking time bomb‚Ä¶&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where is the fuse, the key or trigger? How can we detect and diffuse such intense energy-pockets bent on total destruction? Anxiety and fear are like a virus. Perhaps the solution is to acknowledge, examine, and then contain and discard them. Maybe art can help with this by providing an encapsulation of the subject, something that safely externalizes the issue, providing release. And maybe Time is the key‚Ä¶&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exhibit has no defined expectation for type or style of work to be considered or selected. Submissions can range from the most traditional realism to the most conceptual, abstract, or experimental.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$40 for up to FOUR entries submitted. $5 per each additional entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospectus and entry form visit &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org/timebombs." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Email inquiries to info@manifestgallery.org&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/d65e62d9-a343-4bb2-b0ff-b1577974d80c" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>6617c1de-cab1-4998-935d-94cbebdf69a7</id><title>10/7 - Public Art Opportunity: American Legion Memorial Stadium Rennovation</title><updated>2019-10-08T13:27:02.754751+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Science Council&lt;br/&gt;üìç Charlotte, NC, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 10/07/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://www.artsandscience.org/resources-for/artists/calls-to-artists/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arts &amp; Science Council (ASC) is accepting qualifications from professional artists or teams of artists in response to a public art opportunity for Mecklenburg County‚Äôs American Legion Memorial Stadium renovation. ASC is seeking artists or teams of artists with a demonstrated record of creating memorial sculpture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The selected artist/s will be asked to create an artwork that memorializes the American Legion and its service to military service members, veterans, and their families. The desired artwork will include, but  is not limited to, representations of the human figure. This artwork will become a signature feature of American Legion Memorial Stadium and should create an atmosphere of reverence that persuades visitors and passers-by to pause and reflect on the service and history of the American Legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The memorial will be proudly sited at the front entrance of the stadium along Charlottetown Ave. ‚Äì adjacent to Independent Park and connected via the Little Sugar Creek Greenway. Positioned along the stadium security fence, the memorial is accessible from both outside and inside the stadium. The artwork for the memorial will be integrated into a terraced slope. This terrace will include signage for American Legion Memorial Stadium and insignia representing the five branches of the military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finalists will have the opportunity to meet with stakeholders from Mecklenburg County American Legion posts, Park and Recreation staff, and the project design consultants in order to learn more about the site and scope for the memorial. Each finalist will be tasked with creating a conceptual proposal for the memorial artwork, and the commissioned artist will be selected based on their proposal and qualifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artwork created for this project should be constructed of durable materials and designed in coordination with staff from Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation and Asset and Facility Management, the Historic Landmarks Commission, Jenkins Peer Architects and LandDesign, and representatives from various Mecklenburg County American Legion posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the full application and submit qualifications at: &lt;a href="https://www.artsandscience.org/resources-for/artists/calls-to-artists/" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.artsandscience.org&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/6617c1de-cab1-4998-935d-94cbebdf69a7" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>4e0c11b5-c06b-40e2-9288-512287aace60</id><title>10/4 - Charlotte Douglas International Airport Concourse A Expansion‚ÄìPhase II</title><updated>2019-10-08T13:27:02.754689+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Science Council&lt;br/&gt;üìç Charlotte, NC, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 10/04/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://www.artsandscience.org/resources-for/artists/calls-to-artists/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLT Concourse A - Phase II Art Program is comprised of 2 opportunities for permanent, integrated artworks, each with differing budgets dependent on the projects‚Äô respective size, prominence of location, and anticipated material and fabrication needs.
