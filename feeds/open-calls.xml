The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) is one of the country's largest public university systems and Pennsylvania's sole land-grant institution. Penn State's community includes 100,000 students across 24 campuses and 17,000 faculty and staff dedicated to making a positive impact on communities around the world. &#13;
&#13;
The projects will result from collaboration between eight artists and the host sites they are partnered with. The exact vision, form, location, installation duration, and materials for the project will be determined by the artist in collaboration with their university partner.&#13;
&#13;
We are seeking visual artists or teams that include a visual artist and there are no residency requirements for this opportunity. Professional and emerging artists who are new to the field of public art are encouraged to apply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA&#13;
We are seeking visual artists or teams that include a visual artist. There are no residency requirements for this opportunity, but applicants should be aware that the program requires site visits and in-person collaboration with partners. Professional and emerging artists who are new to the field of public art and/or have experience working with students are encouraged to apply. Faculty and students of Penn State University are eligible to apply.&#13;
&#13;
Penn State is an equal opportunity, affirmative action employer, and is committed to providing opportunities to all qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. &#13;
&#13;
Applications will be reviewed on the following criteria:&#13;
‚Ä¢	Aesthetic quality of previous work&#13;
‚Ä¢	Experience working collaboratively&#13;
‚Ä¢	Experience working in the public realm or with communities in interdisciplinary settings&#13;
‚Ä¢	Quality and completeness of application materials&#13;
&#13;
ABOUT&#13;
The participating partner sites are:&#13;
‚Ä¢	Center for Performing Arts at Penn State (University Park)&#13;
‚Ä¢	LGBTQA Student Resource Center (University Park)&#13;
‚Ä¢	Penn State Abington &#13;
‚Ä¢	Penn State Beaver&#13;

‚Ä¢	Penn State Erie, The Behrend College&#13;
‚Ä¢	Penn State Lehigh Valley&#13;
‚Ä¢	Penn State Materials Research Institute (University Park)&#13;
&#13;
These partners will serve on the selection panel, along with representatives from Campus Arts and additional arts professionals. Once each organization is partnered with an artist, the artist will work with stakeholders at the host site to develop a proposal for the design and implementation of a temporary public art project/intervention. The resulting works will be catalysts for community and student engagement, making the arts central to the Penn State experience.&#13;
&#13;
Temporary artworks are expected to be present at the site, on loan, for up to one year. Please note that the purpose of this program is to provide an opportunity for partners and artists to collaborate on developing new ideas for temporary artworks. It is not a funding stream to implement existing plans or concepts for specific works of art. &#13;
&#13;
The selected artists will enter into a contractual agreement with the university and their partner site. This program is supported by a grant through Penn State‚Äôs Strategic Planning Seed Grant.&#13;
&#13;
BUDGET&#13;
Each artwork has a budget of $7,000. Artists will be asked to generate a budget within this framework that includes an artist‚Äôs fee, materials and fabrication costs, site visits, project management, and installation and de-installation of the work. Artists are required to furnish proof of general liability insurance before funds are dispersed. Projects will be considered on loan from the artist for a period of up to one year. Please note that at least two site visits (one initial visit and one during installation) are required.&#13;
&#13;
Partners will select artists with guidance from Campus Arts. Depending on the scale and scope of the proposed collaborations, additional resources may be sought on a case by case basis.&#13;
&#13;
SELECTION PROCESS&#13;
Campus Arts will facilitate the artist selection process. Qualifications submitted through this RFQ will be reviewed by a selection committee. A limited number of artists will be invited for an interview. Only one artist or artist team will be chosen for each partner site.&#13;
&#13;
During the interview process, artists will discuss their past work, their ability to work on the project, their interest in this particular project, and their experience collaborating with communities. The artists who are asked to interview for the project will not be asked to develop a model or proposal.&#13;
&#13;
Artists may interview with multiple partners, but can only be selected for one project. &#13;

Superfine! NYC '19 applications close on Wednesday, March 27th, however applications are reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis. 60% of artist booths and 30% of gallery booths are already reserved by other cutting-edge, new contemporary exhibitors, and all booths will likely be sold out before the application deadline. Here's what's still available:&#13;
&#13;
GALLERIES:&#13;
‚Ä¢ 18 booths in our Gallery Pavilion ranging from 16 - 32 linear feet of wall ($4,000 - $8,000)&#13;
&#13;
SOLO ARTISTS:&#13;
‚Ä¢ 4 Elevate Booths: 12-foot artist booths; the fair's most popular size ($3,000)&#13;

Superfine! receives frequent and consistent media coverage in outlets like Washington Post, New York Post, and Artnet, and the fair holds the key to the growing, "maturing", and engaged young collector masses. About 20% of visitors make a significant purchase of at least $500, and 90% of past exhibitors report selling to almost exclusively new clients outside of their existing collector network.&#13;
&#13;
Superfine! NYC will be hosted from May 1-5 on 14th Street in the Meatpacking District (at the foot of the bustling High Line Park).

&#13;
ABOUT PAIR&#13;
DCLA‚Äôs Public Artist in Residence program (PAIR) is based on the premise that artists are creative problem solvers. To that end, DCLA embeds socially engaged artists in New York City municipal agencies in order to use creative, collaborative art practice to propose and implement creative solutions to pressing civic challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Launched in 2015, PAIR takes its name and inspiration from the pioneering work of artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the first official artist in residence with the NYC Department of Sanitation (1977- present).  Since establishing the program, DCLA has embedded 10 artists in 8 agencies, including Tania Bruguera at the Mayor‚Äôs Office of Immigrant Affairs, The Lost Collective at the Administration for Children‚Äôs Services, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh at the Commission on Human Rights, among others. For a full list of PAIRs to date, click here.  &#13;
&#13;
All of the PAIR partnerships ‚Äì some of which are still ongoing ‚Äì vary greatly in concept, scope, duration, and populations engaged, and their successes are driven by the openness of the partner agencies and the artist-led, collaborative process that the PAIR program framework provides. &#13;
&#13;
RESIDENCY STRUTURE, FEES, and MATERIALS&#13;
PAIR residencies begin with a required half-day orientation session, which kicks off a three-month Research Phase.  This Phase is a time for the artist and agency to establish mutual trust through shared exposure to each other‚Äôs work and process‚Äîthe artist shadows agency staff and attends meetings, trainings and site visits, and in turn the agency hosts an artist talk and visits the artist at their studio.  &#13;
&#13;
The Research Phase ends with the artist proposing a project, designed in collaboration with the partner agency, to produce during the remaining eight months of the residency.  The Implementation Phase of the residency is marked by approval of the project proposal and initiation of the work.  The proposed project must be collaborative in nature and include at least one (1) public-facing event or component. Both DCLA and the partner agency will continue to provide the artist support during the project‚Äôs production for the duration of the residency.  &#13;
&#13;
Throughout the residency, the artist and agencies have weekly check-ins by phone or in-person to assist in project production.&#13;
&#13;
PAIR funding per residency is $40,000: $20,000 for the Research Phase and $20,000 for the Implementation Phase. Funding is inclusive of related project expenses (e.g., printing, materials, equipment, video production, etc.). The selected artist(s) are responsible for managing the project budget and submitting invoices. No additional funding is provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://nyculture.submittable.com/submit&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/853b22e8-17d6-4525-8ba8-c70974c17aa0" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>6c6e7218-1f0b-49ee-97aa-c956b5ace00a</id><title>Call for Artists/Designers</title><updated>2019-01-31T02:17:05.796255+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Southern Vermont Arts Center&lt;br/&gt;üìç Manchester, VT, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 03/01/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.svac.org/wilson/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern Vermont Arts Center (SVAC) is excited to announce their upcoming exhibition, Unusual Threads: Stitching Together the Future of Fashion, opening on May 11, 2019.

March 15, 2019 ‚Äì April 13, 2019&#13;
This is an open call to artists for an exhibition at Site:Brooklyn Gallery.&#13;
&#13;
The human body has inspired artists throughout the ages ‚Äì it was often used to explore myth and allegory, signify beauty, sexuality, or life itself. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries saw a significant expansion of the importance of the body in art. Bodily representation still acts as a repository for beauty, nature, or religious ideas, but it has also taken on new roles. They bear and sometimes thwart identity, are sites of political and social struggle, and are fragmented or unseen.&#13;

&#13;
The stuff is all around us, to the point of becoming a global bio-crisis, yet at Manifest we have seen sublime and compelling works of art give new life and meaning to such cast-off materials from time to time. Whether through pure recycling of pre-used materials into new forms, by employing them 'virgin' to create art, or by making more traditional work about them, we invite artists to share works of art focused on, created from, or made about packaging materials of any and all types.&#13;
&#13;
All types of work are welcome, including traditional and non-traditional approaches in any media, and any subject, non-objective, abstract, conceptual, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Artists are encouraged to take a broadly creative view of the theme. The artists we invite to jury our exhibits enjoy surprise, creative solutions, and most of all exceptionally well put together visual art. The bottom line is that work must be by, of, or about packaging materials.&#13;
&#13;
ANNUAL CASH AWARD: The annual Manifest Grand Jury Prize will result in the awarding of one significant cash prize¬†($2500) to a single work selected as the 'best of the entire season'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply online at http://www.manifestgallery.org/packaged.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/e8745af9-6bb1-4c33-bffa-2d9541ce6366" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>413c9d2e-3fd2-44e9-a10d-092432aa634c</id><title>The 3rd Art Olympia International Open Art Competition</title><updated>2019-01-31T02:17:05.796111+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Art Olympia Executive Committee Office&lt;br/&gt;üìç  , N/A&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 03/15/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $60.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://artolympia.info"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art Olympia is an open art competition held as a biennial event with the goal of discovering talented artists from around the world and supporting their art activities.

This new, site- specific exterior mural or graphic treatment will embrace creative design solutions and reflect Cortex‚Äôs spirit of energy, innovation and community collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
Cortex is working with Via Partnership to help manage the selection process which is open to artists and designers with the capacity to successfully complete design and installation/fabrication of the project within the timeline.  &#13;
&#13;
ABOUT THE CORTEX INNOVATION COMMUNITY&#13;
The Cortex Innovation Community is a vibrant 200-acre innovation hub and technology district in the heart of St. Louis City. It sits between St. Louis‚Äô Central West End and Forest Park Southeast neighborhoods and is surrounded by nationally ranked universities and medical centers, cultural assets, historic neighborhoods, and public spaces, including the Grand Center Arts District, Forest Park, and the Grove. The complete Cortex development plan includes support for $2.3 billion of development: 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use buildings (research, office, clinical, residential, hotel, and retail), as well as a MetroLink light-rail station, a publicly-accessible park, and 15,000 permanent technology-related jobs for the St. Louis region. Currently, over 390 companies call the Cortex Innovation Community home. The Community is an open place for big thinkers and risk takers, home to tech startups, manufacturers, corporate research and development teams, nonprofit organizations, and local restaurants, as well as entrepreneurs, artists, designers, side-hustlers, researchers, chefs, and students -- anyone who wants to build a product, grow a business, throw a party, or make connections.&#13;
&#13;
ABOUT CORTEX&#13;
Cortex is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that oversees development of the Cortex Innovation Community, founded by Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University, University of Missouri - St. Louis, BJC Healthcare, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. Cortex staff and leadership are committed to creating a community in which everyone has access to office space, capital investment, business education, mentoring, and community events. We are building a dynamic, 24/7 neighborhood of restaurants, nightlife, shops green spaces, and apartments. Cortex is committed to fostering an innovation community in which the benefits of new company formation, capital investment, job creation and wealth generation extend to all. We work closely with our District innovation centers, founding partners, and other entrepreneur support organizations across the region to create and strengthen that community. We recognize that we are part of a larger movement for inclusive economic transformation of the St. Louis region. &#13;
&#13;
ART PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
The Cortex Parking Garage is currently under construction. It is located in the center of the Cortex Innovation Community to the east of the 4220 Duncan building. The south fa√ßade of the garage will face the future Chouteau Greenway urban trail and a recently opened MetroLink light rail station. &#13;
&#13;
Phase 1 of the garage will have five levels made up of three bays that together are 179 feet long. The construction of Phase 1 is scheduled to be completed in May 2019. A future expansion of the garage to the east would add another two to three bays and five to six levels. While the artwork installation for Phase 2 of the garage will not occur within the current timeline, finalists will create a design for both portions of the structure, as explained below. &#13;
&#13;
The new artwork on the south fa√ßade of the parking garage will be viewed by those entering and exiting the garage and will be highly visible to both MetroLink riders and passersby on the Chouteau Greenway. The artwork will also be visible to pedestrians and drivers from many other vantage points throughout the area and from nearby structures. &#13;
&#13;
The artwork should make use of the design of the structure in creating a site-specific piece. Proposals are not requested at this time, but finalists selected to develop a proposal will need to work within the technical constraints of the garage design, phased construction schedule and consideration of additional areas of the garage in their design. Detailed information will be shared with finalists to include the following considerations:&#13;
‚Ä¢	Completed artwork should be permanent or semi-permanent with a minimum longevity of ten years. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Minimal additional weight can be added to the structure of the garage and the artwork must not hinder air flow through garage openings. A painted mural, graphic treatment, or lightweight attachments to the garage face would be possible. Electricity can be made available. Finalists will be free to explore creative solutions in their concept proposals within the technical constraints. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Finalists‚Äô concept proposals will address both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the garage construction. Because the Phase 1 artwork will be completed before the construction of Phase 2, the first phase of artwork must be both independent and complementary with the design of Phase 2.&#13;
‚Ä¢	Finalists have the option to include the south stair concrete element in the scope of their design. The selected artist will also be consulted in selecting a complimentary color treatment for the west fa√ßade and northwest stair concrete element and elevator shaft.&#13;
&#13;
ART PROJECT GOALS&#13;
The project should achieve the following goals:&#13;
‚Ä¢	Build on the image of Cortex as a premier national and international innovation hub.&#13;
‚Ä¢	Reflect the spirit of the cutting edge, vibrant and energetic Cortex community. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Serve as a gateway and point of arrival into Cortex.&#13;
‚Ä¢	Create an iconic point of interest to bring attention to Cortex and help spread Cortex‚Äôs message.&#13;
‚Ä¢	Use a functional parking infrastructure in a creative, innovative way. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Highlight the interplay of movement seen from the MetroLink and the Chouteau Greenway to emphasize energy and activity.&#13;
‚Ä¢	As one of the first major public art commissions in Cortex, set a high bar that energizes the community to use public art in future developments and public spaces.   &#13;
&#13;
ARTIST SELECTION PROCESS&#13;
‚Ä¢	Artist submissions will be reviewed by an Artist Selection Panel (ASP), made up of regional curators, arts leadership and design professionals from the St. Louis community, as well as Cortex stakeholders. &#13;
‚Ä¢	The ASP will select up to three (3) finalists to develop and present concept proposals. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Finalists will receive a stipend of $5000 to participate in the concept proposal process, which will include touring Cortex and meeting community members prior to developing a proposal, and to present their proposal. Proposals will include renderings and a short narrative description addressing both Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as a preliminary budget and timeline for completing Phase 1. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Finalists will return to St. Louis to present their concept proposals directly to the ASP in person and to present their design at a Venture Caf√© Gathering, which is open to the public. Feedback from attendees of this presentation will be shared with the ASP.  The ASP will recommend a final artist/design for the project. &#13;
‚Ä¢	Artists living more than 100 miles from Cortex will be paid an additional amount up to $2000 for travel and lodging expenses in St. Louis for visits during the selection process, including the finalists‚Äô introduction to Cortex and the presentations of the concept proposal.&#13;
&#13;
FINALIST SELECTION CRITERIA&#13;
The following criteria will be used by the Artist Selection Panel to select up to three (3) finalists.&#13;
‚Ä¢	Artistic excellence as demonstrated by past work and submitted materials.&#13;
‚Ä¢	A clear understanding of the project.&#13;
‚Ä¢	A body of work that demonstrates an ability to create an artwork that responds to the goals of the project.&#13;

If the selected artist fabricates and installs the artwork themselves, the selected artist will be responsible for bringing all required materials needed for installation, including approved scaffolding and equipment to be able to safely reach the facade, assistants to complete the process in the agreed-upon timeframe, painting supplies and liability insurance coverage.&#13;
‚Ä¢	Recommend a color treatment for the west fa√ßade, and northwest stair concrete element and elevator shaft, and, if not included in scope of design, the south stair concrete element to coordinate with the artist‚Äôs design.&#13;

&#13;
As the first project, we started an environmental art campaign 'Recycling Is Culture' in New York City. We support one of NYC's mission 'Zero waste to landfill 2020' and this campaign is about showing art pieces to public with the information of what to recycle in NYC.&#13;
&#13;
We opened the Instagram page 'Recycling is culture' as an idea to contribute our talent to support the mission and also help artists and designers be inspired and showcase their works. &#13;
&#13;
We believe the influence of art can help the community to lead the culture and visually emphasize the importance and the effects of recycling. We also wish this art campaign could give valuable influence to next generation.&#13;
&#13;
This call is part of the art campaign and the artwork should be created by specific topic and color code.&#13;
&#13;
This is an opportunity for artists to experiment with new ideas in the global issue and utilize 'Recycling Is Culture' as a valuable resource.&#13;
&#13;
The works will be exhibited at our gallery space on March 2019.&#13;
&#13;
Our long term goal is to present the contributed artworks on the construction fences on the street as recycling the space. New York itself is already a culture, and we sincerely wish that the 'Recycling Is Culture' campaign can elevate NYC's art &amp; culture and positively influence other cities around the globe.&#13;
&#13;
Topic:&#13;
&#13;
The topic should include one of garbage subject and contains NYC's recycling color code; Blue(Plastic, Metal, Glass, Carton), Green(Paper), Grey scale(Landfill).&#13;
&#13;
Topic and color code is based on DSNY's recycle poster.&#13;
Please refer to other artists works on our website.&#13;

MvVO ART, creator of AD ART SHOW, is turning the streets of New York‚Äôs most art-centric neighborhoods into a revolutionary Art Show, digitally exhibiting contemporary Art on the LinkNYC network on select streets during Frieze Week‚ÄîMay 1 to 4, 2019. &#13;
 &#13;
AD ART SHOW celebrates the ART created by artists currently working in advertising, or with roots in the advertising/design/commercial arts industries, as they follow in the footsteps of Warhol, Magritte, Haring, Dali and the many other world-renowned artists who worked in advertising.&#13;
 &#13;
The inaugural AD ART SHOW 2018 was a phenomenal success, bringing the Art, Media and Advertising world together for a 4 day show at Sotheby‚Äôs with 92 artists from advertising from around the world. AD ART SHOW 2019 transforms the LinkNYC network into an outdoor art show during the biggest week of the City‚Äôs art calendar‚ÄîFrieze Week.&#13;
 &#13;
The selection committee is made up of contemporary art experts and influential collectors.&#13;

May 31 ‚Äì July 13, 2019&#13;
‚Äã&#13;
In the United States, freedom has historically been linked to the right to move as one pleases.  This limited understanding of freedom has led to the creation of a system that constrains the movement of the many to reinforce the supposed freedom of the few. Policies of containment can be found throughout the history of the United States: Japanese internment camps, Native American reservation systems, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Jim Crow segregation, not to mention today‚Äôs mass incarceration of people of color, the travel ban blocking entry to those from majority-Muslim nations, and the shutdown of the government over the funding of a border wall between the United States and Mexico.  &#13;
‚Äã&#13;
In our modern history of art, freedom has also been conceptualized as movement: the avant-garde push our society forward through their new and unconventional choices.  Like the first line of an army charging into battle, these artists attempt novel works of art while denying any previous influences or collaborators. This concept of freedom has restricted our understanding of what artistic genius looks like to the domain of white men, who, as art historian Linda Nochlin famously pointed out, have suffered from less societal restrictions to their claims of independence and exceptionality. &#13;
 &#13;
Contemporary artists and historians working in disability studies, gender studies, critical race theory, and queer theory, among other fields, have begun the important work of dismantling the conflation of freedom with movement.  How does our current limited definition of freedom support hegemonic capitalist, nationalist, sexist, racist, ablest, homophobic, transphobic systems of power in the art world and beyond? How can we visualize alternative notions of freedom through art? How can mobility participate in the limitation or denial of such freedoms? And what happens when artists and viewers not only resist moving forward, but choose to stand shockingly still? &#13;
 &#13;
The group exhibition, Art Stands Still, will open at Collar Works, a repurposed textile factory, within Troy, New York, a city that was once celebrated for its position at the forefront of American industrial achievement. Like many Rust Belt economies, it experienced a sharp economic decline in the late twentieth century. What is forward for cities like Troy? Art Stands Still looks to create a place for a community of alternatives to spatial, temporal, and social advancement.  Works may be connected to the theme broadly and all media will be considered.&#13;

Superfine! LA '19 applications officially close this Friday, January 25th, and there are still a small handful of gallery and solo artist booths up for grabs. Here's what's still available:&#13;
&#13;
GALLERIES:&#13;
‚Ä¢ SIX booths in our Gallery Pavilion ranging from 16 - 32 linear feet of wall ($3,600 - $7,200)&#13;
&#13;
SOLO ARTISTS:&#13;
‚Ä¢ THREE Elevate/LA Booths: 12-foot artist booths dedicated to LA-based artists ($2,700)&#13;
&#13;
MULTIMEDIA ARTISTS, COLLECTIVES, GALLERIES, + CURATORS:&#13;
‚Ä¢ ONE A/V Room: 575 square foot room for audio, visual, VR, AR, olfactory-and-beyond projects ($3,000)&#13;
&#13;
Superfine! receives frequent and consistent media coverage in outlets like Washington Post, New York Post, and Artnet, and the fair holds the key to the growing, "maturing", and engaged young collector masses. About 20% of visitors make a significant purchase of at least $500, and 90% of past exhibitors report selling to almost exclusively new clients outside of their existing collector network.&#13;
&#13;
Superfine! LA will be hosted from February 14-17 at DTLA's familiar Magic Box convention center. Superfine! is an art fair engineered for galleries who recognize a needed shift in the art market and for artists treating their talents as a serious art business.&#13;

Bridgette Mayer Art Advisors in collaboration with The Executive Committee of The Bower is seeking to commission professional artist/sculptor and or artist teams to design, fabricate and oversee fabrication and install permanent site-specific sculptures or permanent land art installations as part of its launch of its Phase I Bower Sculpture Park and Gardens. &#13;
&#13;
SITE DESCRIPTION&#13;
THE BOWER: SCULPTURE PARK AND GARDENS is located in Shermans Dale, PA (30 minutes outside of Harrisburg, PA). &#13;
The location is a private property that will be turned into a public sculpture park and gardens. The future plans also include an artist studio, an artist residency program, possible gallery/exhibition space and public programming with various museums and collecting groups. There are meadow, garden and woodland settings on the property where the commissioned sculptures and projects would be placed. &#13;
&#13;
It is the Owners vision to curate an array of sculptural works, both large scale and intimate, that present visual interest from multiple perspectives. The works shall be designed to complement, enhance or provide interesting contrast within the natural setting. The construction shall be durable to withstand the changing seasons and weather elements and also shall be safe for interaction by visitors.&#13;
&#13;
Chosen artwork will be required to withstand a high-traffic, unmonitored outdoor environment with very limited maintenance. Artists should take into consideration the possibility of adverse weather conditions, the wellbeing of pedestrian traffic passing by and through the site and the safety of the audience.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS&#13;
&#13;
The Owners are developing ‚ÄúThe Bower: Sculpture Park and Gardens‚Äù, a rural setting, garden and sculpture park located on their 36-acre wooded and meadow site along the northern slope of the Appalachian Mountains in Perry County, Pennsylvania.&#13;
&#13;
Approximately 5-10 finalists will be chosen from the pool of applicants, those finalists will be provided an honorarium up to $1500.00* to work with Bridgette Mayer Art Advisors and feedback from the Executive Committee to develop a final proposal for the artwork. The chosen artists/teams will then be commissioned to finalize design, fabricate, ship and install the artwork.&#13;
&#13;
Artists may utilize imported materials of their choosing or landforming, stone, wood or other organics from the natural setting. &#13;
&#13;
*For artists wishing to submit already fabricated sculpture works, they can do so for consideration, however please note if a work is selected that is already fabricated, an honorarium will not be provided in this instance.&#13;
&#13;
*(Please note BMAA and Executive Committee will discern amount of honorarium to be given out based on potential travel and or other expenses of the particular applicant and an amount of up to $1500.00 will be awarded).&#13;
&#13;
BUDGET&#13;
&#13;
Total project budget is approximately $10K-30K per artist or artist team and the amount awarded will be dependent on the proposed project. It is inclusive of all costs such as artist‚Äôs fees, fabrication, travel, and installation time and effort. A separate shipping budget should also be proposed. Sculpture foundation, lighting, hardscape and landscaping requirements will be determined in collaboration with the Owners and will be addressed outside the budget established for the artwork.  &#13;
