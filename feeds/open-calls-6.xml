Smack Mellon is currently accepting applications from Emerging Artists to be considered for this exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-identifying women, in particular, are often overlooked as figures to be emulated, exempt from the label of ‚Äúgenius‚Äù so readily bestowed upon men. Partially inspired by John Waters‚Äôs Role Models, a pseudo-autobiography through his influences or ‚Äúfilth elders,‚Äù the exhibition will emphasize work that presents women and women-identifying role models as sources of possibility, creativity, courage, self-fashioning and sometimes, transgression. While teens‚Äô fanatical impulse to paper their bedroom walls with imagery of their favorite stars is seen as merely an adolescent phase, Idol Worship asserts how the identification with role models is especially significant for those alienated from dominant social institutions, whether the biological family, history, or mainstream culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idol Worship will be organized by guest curator Emily Colucci, whose proposal was selected through the Curatorial Proposal open call. To help elevate the profile of and bring greater exposure to emerging artists, this exhibition will include a combination of emerging artists chosen from an open call, as well as selected established artists. This open call is only for emerging artists, and at least half of the artists in the exhibition will be selected from this pool of applicants. An emerging artist is considered to be an artist without commercial representation who has a dedicated art practice but few opportunities to show at gallery or non-profit spaces. Submissions will be reviewed by the guest curator and Smack Mellon staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists whose practice includes paying tribute to, obsessing over, embodying, or otherwise complex engagements with women and women-identifying role models, heroes, idols, or filth elders, whether famous public figures, underground cult superstars, lesser known private muses, problematic faves, or unlikely sources of inspiration, are encouraged to apply. Transdisciplinary artists and cultural producers exploring the potential of role model worship as a source of sustainment are also of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibition will run from November 16 through December 29, 2019 (opening date to be confirmed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emily Colucci is a writer, curator and co-founder of Filthy Dreams, an award-winning blog analyzing art, culture and politics through a queer lens and a touch of camp. In 2016, she was awarded the Creative Capital | Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant for Filthy Dreams. In addition, Colucci has contributed to exhibition catalogues, most recently for Devan Shimoyama‚Äôs Cry, Baby at the Andy Warhol Museum, artist books, and online and print magazines, such as Conde Nast‚Äôs them., VICE, Salon, LA Review of Books and more. She has previously curated Night Fever at Pittsburgh‚Äôs Future Tenant, and co-curated Party Out Of Bounds: Nightlife As Activism Since 1980 at New York‚Äôs La MaMa Galleria with Visual AIDS, as well as its satellite installation Courtship Disorder by John Walter in London‚Äôs White Cubicle Toilet Gallery at the late George &amp; Dragon Pub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submit your application using Smack Mellon‚Äôs online application portal on Submittable: &lt;a href="https://smackmellon.submittable.com/submit." target="_blank"&gt;https://smackmellon.submittable.com&lt;/a&gt; We welcome submissions of existing works and proposals for new projects.
