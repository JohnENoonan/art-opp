Set within a derelict industrial Park, PADA is a studio provider, international residency and gallery promoting interaction between national and international artists. Both practicing artists, Tim and Diana set up PADA with the aim of creating a unique resource for artists, to provide excellent studios and fabrication facilities alongside the opportunity to exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having both graduated with BA Hons they have worked in the London art scene for the last 15 years and gained a wealth of experience that they bring to this new project in Lisbon. In this time they have worked for artists such as Damien Hirst, Raqib Shaw and Julian Opie, galleries Alison Jacques and Hauser and Wirth as well as institutions including The Tate, ICA and BFI. The knowledge from assisting and working with these established and well known artists, galleries and institutions informs PADA as a residency that encourages and supports artists development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As PADA they have curated exhibitions in London and Lisbon, the latest exhibition at AMAC in Lisbon, included 40 artists over 4 galleries. 'Out of Office' curated by Alice Bonnot opens on the 11th May at PADA gallery and Recreational Grounds V opens on 17th May in the project space Tim still co curates in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael H.

(JCAL) invites Queens County artists to apply to participate in our newly initiated professional development program, Artists Residency &amp; Training Seminar Series (ARTWorks, Inc.) Program.  It teaches visual artists to regard their work as a small business, identify their entrepreneurial and professional goals and create a long-term plan for accomplishing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚Äã&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARTWorks, Inc. is a two tier program:  Resident Fellows Tier: 2 Resident Fellows receive monetary support of $10,000 each, a full time studio at Jamaica Art Center, access to the ARTWorks, Inc. Seminar Series which will culminate in a curated solo exhibit with inclusion in the ARTWorks, Inc catalogue; Seminar Fellows Tier: Twelve Seminar Fellows are invited to access the 10 month Seminar Series, some scheduled studio time, an exhibit stipend and be included in a group show in JAC‚Äôs Miller gallery and inclusion in the ARTWork, Inc catalogue and receive a $500 stipend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚Äã&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARTWorks, Inc. is a fellowship that serves New York City‚Äôs (favorable to Queens‚Äô artists) emerging and underrepresented artists. It offers training in cultural entrepreneurial skills through hands on practicum, educational seminars and mentorships with established working artists and cultural leaders. The program culminates in a group exhibit that has an ARTWorks, Inc. catalogue for the works created and/or curated during the ARTWorks, Inc. fellowship period. The goal is for the fellows to walk away with knowledge for a successful self fulfilled arts career in a range of communities from self defined and emergent to an existing, well defined and competitive global marketplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ARTWork, Inc. artists have access to JCAL‚Äôs administrative offices and equipment, including a fax machine, copy machine and computers.  In addition to the studio provided, the artist may also use JCAL‚Äôs workshop studio facilities, including a ceramics studio equipped with kilns and a computer design studio.  Theses studios are generally available for use during operating hours Monday through Friday and whenever they are not occupied by JCAL workshops that regularly take place on Saturdays.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARTWorks, Inc. Seminar Series - From October 2019 to August 2020, the seminar schedule includes monthly Off-site Saturdays and/or 3rd Wednesday lectures. Each of the artists will be exposed to mentoring artists and institutional leaders through studio &amp; institutional visits, with peer-to-peer, group and one-on-one guidance and feedback. In addition, JCAL‚Äôs Director of Programs &amp; Artist Services will be available as a resource to discuss issues and provide advice to these artists. At the end of the series, in honor of the group‚Äôs accomplishments, there will be both solo exhibits of the designated two Resident Fellows and the group exhibition for up to 10 ARTWorks, Inc. artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;apply through submitable platform, &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2Xf6xt1" target="_blank"&gt;https://bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;please visit www.jcal.org for instruction&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/011793b9-11eb-4b40-8c37-bf5182cd9a27" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>7011c4f3-8411-472c-a36a-18298a48252e</id><title>6/30 - Open Call: Artist Co-Op 2019</title><updated>2019-05-31T16:17:02.821987+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning&lt;br/&gt;üìç Jamaica, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 06/30/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.jcal.org"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Platform for Queens Based Artists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a membership based program, JCAL's Artist Co-Op has been reborn as the center's annual exhibition featuring emerging and mid-career artists from the borough of Queens and NYC.
