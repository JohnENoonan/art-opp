The selected artist will work with the ASC, Charlotte Water staff, C Design, and local communities to create artwork that is complementary to the architectural design of the facility and reflect the service of Charlotte Water and the history and character of West Charlotte. The selected artist or artist team will be expected to engage with both Charlotte Water staff and area residents to develop the concept for their work. The selected artist will have the opportunity to create engaging, freestanding artwork/s that are complementary to the sites. Two site locations have been identified as possible opportunities for artwork placement: the front entrance along Tyvola Road and the plaza space directly adjacent to the facility. The selected artist/s may choose to site artwork at either or both sites. The artwork should be visually impactful, so scale, materials, and project budget will need to be closely considered. The Tyvola Road entrance site will be highly visible to vehicular traffic. Artwork sited at this location should serve as a landmark representing Charlotte Water and the communities of West Charlotte. For security purposes, access to the Zone Four Field Operations facility is limited. Charlotte Water staff will primarily enjoy artwork sited at the facility plaza with local residents encountering the artwork during visits to the facility‚Äôs community space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the complete RFQ, please visit: &lt;a href="https://www.artsandscience.org/resources-for/artists/calls-to-artists/." target="_blank"&gt;https://www.artsandscience.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/fa1f10ba-78ed-41be-9578-3dbdbffb0dfb" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
