This production celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riot where, for the first time in U.S. history, the American LGBTQ community raised a united voice to defend their basic human rights. The show is also dedicated to those who were able to influence humanity through their great achievements in the arts, politics, philosophy, and science, despite the persecution that they had to endure as homosexuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poems by queer poets such as Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, and Arthur Rimbaud are set as art songs by Gihieh Lee, a celebrated Korean composer. Korean-American director Byungkoo Ahn transforms the song cycle into a series of musical vignettes about 13 LGBTQ figures who changed the world through their work. Although the characters and the poets lived in different time periods and cultures, many of them had to disguise their true identities in order to survive society‚Äôs discrimination. However, despite the judgement of society, they were able to express their true selves through their works of art and literature. Their bravery paved the way for their descendants who came out to the streets of Greenwich Village in 1969 during the Stonewall Riot. '13 Fruitcakes: Musical Vignettes' captures and revitalizes those moments of truth in the queer foreparents‚Äô lives through the power of art songs and queer literature of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NO FEE to apply. &lt;br/&gt;** We are open to all Gender Identities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WE ARE INVITING YOU TO SUBMIT VIDEO WORKS THAT CAN CREATIVELY ADDRESS THE LIFE OF THE FOLLOWING LGBTQ FIGURES. &lt;br/&gt;Harmodius and Aristogeiton&lt;br/&gt;Dong Xian (Ëë£Ë≥¢)&lt;br/&gt;King Hyegong (ÌòúÍ≥µÏôï) &lt;br/&gt;Leonardo da Vinci &lt;br/&gt;Hans Christian Andersen&lt;br/&gt;Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&lt;br/&gt;Gertrude Stein&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Woolf&lt;br/&gt;Alan Turing &lt;br/&gt;Frida Kahlo and Josephine Baker&lt;br/&gt;Eleanor Roosevelt &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT CRITERIA ABOUT THE VIDEO SUBMISSION (MUST READ)&lt;br/&gt;1.
