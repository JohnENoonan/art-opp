The theme is: Adelante, the Future. To be held in Emeline Park, located on the shore of the Hudson River in the Village of Haverstraw, September 14th, 2019. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an experimental spirit, we welcome artists interested in moving from the traditional studio, gallery and museum space into the freedom of an outdoor landscape setting with site specific and community accessible art, by making a themed-seating-parklet or vignette, sited on the water front of the Hudson. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PARKLETS: traditionally started by taking a lowly parking spot, encouraging their transformation into parks, playgrounds, pop-up caf√©s ‚Äì anything other than their intended use. We are redefining the concept by asking artists to create a small themed seating vignette within our park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Parklets should be an interactive art seating project assembled on-site with a mission to reference any aspect of the ‚Äúcultural landscape‚Äù of this vibrant river town, celebrating the strength of melding its diverse cultural heritage, while it moves future forward over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PARKLET may take form, in any media that can withstand the weather, and site conditions for one day. Re-cyclables are encouraged but not required. Immersive mixed media parklet installations of seating with sculpture, painting, mixed media, tactical and site performance, temporal installations, video, sound projections, or multimedia digital platforms are acceptable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The festival will include live music, food, craft venders along with NYC, South Street Sea Port's Schooner, Pioneer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requests for proposals.
