ABC invites emerging artists of color to submit 2D works of art to our group exhibition, “Level - Up Society.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the rules that govern gaming cultural (both tactile and virtual), ABC considers how the social contracts and consent required to play any game inform a microcosm for the way our larger social structures operate. ABC would like to oppose the structures that deny access, equity, and inclusion in support of a more equal playing field for people of color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We challenge artists to imagine and create a new reality where disadvantaged communities truly advance to the next level! What does a “leveled - up” society look like to you? What social contracts would need to be put in place to elevate marginalized groups in society? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We look forward to reviewing your submissions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply for our 2019 group exhibition, please send your CV/Resume along with high resolution images of your piece in .jpg format to levelupsociety2019@gmail.com no later than August 31st,2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/a8810648-d56c-4b63-9e11-eb8487269302" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
