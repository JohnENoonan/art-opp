In an upcoming juried show, the Art School of Columbia County is exploring the idea of region: its boundaries (real or perceived), the role of artists in documenting and defining region and identity, the concept of a regional school, and the connection between artists and community.&lt;br/&gt;Artists age 18 and up living or working in within a 100 mile radius of Ghent NY, are invited to apply to ASCC‚Äôs juried regional show exploring the theme of Reimagining Region.  &lt;br/&gt;Works will be selected for artistic merit and how they explore and relate to the selected theme.&lt;br/&gt;Selected artists may be chosen to participate in ASCC‚Äôs 5th annual ARTalks series, featuring a guided panel discussion and reception.  Work in the exhibit will be viewed as part of an educational program on Saturday, April 6, ‚ÄúSlow Art Day,‚Äù an international day held to promote mindfulness and deep engagement with art in museums and educational institutions.
