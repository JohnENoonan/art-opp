The Drawing Marathon offers Binghamton University students, alumni and community artists (18 and over) a unique opportunity to compete for 24 hours to produce a finished figure drawing in the museum. It is a chance to discover one‚Äôs artistic second wind, when powerful creative energy is released at the very time physical energy diminishes. This second wind reinvigorates both mind and body, and can result in a rewarding, even spectacular artistic creation. &lt;br/&gt;WHEN: Friday, April 5, 10:00 am‚ÄìSaturday, April 6, 10:00 am (24 hours with regular breaks).&lt;br/&gt;EVENT DETAILS: A clothed, live model, basic charcoal drawing materials, paper (72‚Äù x 48‚Äù), and easel will be provided. Light refreshments will be provided. Participating artists are responsible for all other expenses incurred, e.g., transportation, special foods. Artists are urged to consider the mental and physical aspects of this endeavor and must feel that they can safely participate. Dressing in layers of comfortable clothing is recommended.  The event is held in a public setting so that visitors may observe artists at work throughout the  24-hour marathon period. Participants are expected to spend most of the 24 hours in the museum drawing and taking frequent scheduled breaks. &lt;br/&gt;AWARDS:  Two cash prizes will be awarded on the morning of Saturday, April 6: the jury prize of $1000 and the people‚Äôs prize of $500. The people‚Äôs prize will be awarded on the basis of qualitative comments received by visitors to the marathon as well as statements posted on the Binghamton University Art Museum Facebook age. In addition to these prizes the Binghamton University Fine Art Society (BUFAS) will give a basket of art supplies to one artist demonstrating the most creative or  innovative approach to drawing.&lt;br/&gt;TIMELINE:  The competition will commence Friday, April 5 at 10:00 am. At the end of every hour there will be 15-minute break for the model and participants. Every four hours there will be a 30-minute break. An award ceremony will follow shortly after the competition concludes on Saturday, April 6 at 10:00 am. The drawings will remain on view in the museum through Tuesday, April 9. Participants must retrieve their finished drawings by Saturday, April 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLICATION: Artists should send one pdf file with up to 10 samples of their best figure drawings, along with the following contact information: name, address, phone number and email.
