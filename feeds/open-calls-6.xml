Repetition and seriality are built into the every level of photography from the production process, to its aesthetic theory, to the real-life practice of taking pictures. Photographs are often seen as representations or repetitions of reality itself, all while photography itself shapes modern consciousness just as much as it re-creates it. Site:Brooklyn is looking for work that actively engages with all aspects of repetition and series in photography. This might include subject matter, formal qualities, method, presentation, and much else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Elisabeth Biondi has been an independent curator, writer. Before that she was the Visuals Editor of The New Yorker for 15 years, where she shaped the look of the publication by establishing a group of staff photographers, commissioning both masters and emerging talent. She built the magazine‚Äôs reputation for its use of photography, for which it received numerous awards, including two National Magazine Awards. Her independent curation includes Subjective/Objective and Under the Bridge for the New York PhotoFestival and New Yorker Fiction/Real Photography at Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea. Most recently she was a judge in the eight-episodes Sky Arts ‚ÄòMaster of Photography‚Äô, which aired in May/June/July of 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE GALLERY:&lt;br/&gt;Site:Brooklyn Gallery located in Brooklyn, New York is dedicated to exhibiting the current practice of contemporary artists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;DATES:&lt;br/&gt;Call Announcement: February 7, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Final Submission Deadline: March 14, 2019 11:59 PM MT&lt;br/&gt;Notification Letter: March 23, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Gallery Exhibition: May 3 ‚Äì June 1, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Opening Reception: Friday, May 3, 2019 from 6-9 PM&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY:&lt;br/&gt;This is a juried exhibition for artists working in photography.

For some, it means stripping away the visual irrelevancies of nature in order to explore different subjects, an exploration of the artist‚Äôs own imagination, or finding the essential qualities a form observed in the real world. The freedom of abstraction rests on a paradox: the liberation of non-objective art often meant the new focus on order, form, and purity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Julia Halperin is executive editor of artnet News, where she oversees editorial operations for the world‚Äôs most widely read art news site and manages a staff of editors and writers in London, Berlin, and New York.
