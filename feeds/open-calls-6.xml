As a color, it can lean towards yellow, blue, gray, or brown, while still remaining unquestionably itself. Green evokes associations of landscape and nature ‚Äì everything from the palest new spring buds to the dark evergreens of deep winter. Yet it can also remind us of cities and the manmade ‚Äì green glass skyscrapers, copper rooftops, the Statue of Liberty, and printed money. Emotionally, green has long signified envy, a pit of snakes coiled in the body. But add white and the color turns minty, suggesting more pleasant and peaceful states of mind.  What does green mean to you? How does this elusive color make its way into your work, either as the star player or in a supporting role? The Painting Center is interested in work in all media (under 48‚Äù in any direction) featuring green in any of its manifestations for this juried exhibition. This exhibition is open to all media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibition Dates: April 23 - May 18, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Deadline for Submission: March 25, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Notification Date: March 31, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply via Slide Room: &lt;br/&gt;https://thepaintingcenter.slideroom.com/#/login/program/47070&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shazzi Thomas&lt;br/&gt;Director of The Painting Center&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/25f539f4-dce6-4555-ac2d-d70b180426bf" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>ec862492-be2d-4410-8c3e-ed23b675145c</id><title>5/15 - 84th Annual National Juried Art Exhibition</title><updated>2019-02-14T22:15:49.716064+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cooperstown Art Association&lt;br/&gt;üìç Cooperstown, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 05/15/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $20.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://fs30.formsite.com/CooperstownArt/r3rna8zfuk/index.html"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;84th ANNUAL NATIONAL JURIED ART EXHIBITION,  7/12/19 - 8/16/19.
