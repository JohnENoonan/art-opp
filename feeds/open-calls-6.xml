For this show the jurors are prominent painter Eric Aho and acclaimed photographer Rachel Portesi, husband and wife, and photography has been added to the media accepted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERIC AHO is a prominent American painter known for his gestural, abstract paintings that evoke natural forms. He is represented by DC Moore Gallery in NYC. Born in Melrose, Massachusetts in 1966, he grew up in rural New Hampshire. After studying at the Central School of Art and Design in London, Aho received his BFA from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. Aho completed his graduate work at the Lahti Art Institute in Finland supported by a Fulbright Fellowship in 1991‚Äì92 and an American-Scandinavian Foundation grant in 1993. His works have been exhibited and collected widely in the United States and abroad and are included in the permanent collections of the Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, NH; Denver Art Museum, CO; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Hood Museum of Art, Hanover, NH; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; The Neuberger Museum of Art; and the New Britain Museum of American Art, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RACHEL PORTESI received a BA in Sociology and Photography from Marlboro College, VT. Her work as a black and white documentary photographer was complemented by the acquisition of her first Polaroid Land camera in 1991. Ten years later, with a move to New York City and no access to a darkroom, Portesi‚Äôs practice shifted exclusively to the immediacy of the Polaroid.  Working this way resulted in a body of work produced over more than two decades ending a few years ago when an older, even more finicky, and time-consuming way of making ‚Äúinstant pictures‚Äù caught Portesi‚Äôs attention‚Äîthe wet plate collodion tintype.  Her current projects in tintype are self reflective ‚ÄúHair Portraits.‚Äù Her photographs have been exhibited at various venues in New England and in New York. She works and lives with her family in Saxtons River, Vermont.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY Open to artists 18+years of age, living in the USA. Two-dimensional Media: original oils, acrylics, pastels, watercolors, prints, drawings, photography and mixed media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEES The fee is $40 for 1-3 works. $5 for each additional work up to 6 works total.
