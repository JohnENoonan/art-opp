We are seeking open calls for our 1st edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For h√©catombe‚Äôs first edition we are examining the implications of discomfort and it‚Äôs potential to inspire growth, regression, fear, and hope. Discomfort can reflect a projected incongruence of identity, fueled by the pressures of society and self. This discomfort can be at the epicenter of our dissonance from society: we now face the question if it is the individual or the society which should be made to feel uncomfortable. If so, what is the utility of discomfort for each party? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In approaching this topic and examining your work please consider:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How discomfort helps you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do people benefit from each other's discomfort?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who do you want to see uncomfortable? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you want to be uncomfortable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Currencies is an interdisciplinary collective consisting of artists, musicians, dancers, sculptors and scientists. It was founded in early in May of 2017. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason for the inception of the Hidden Currencies is three fold:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an interdisciplinary creative community to prompt artists to explore new dimensions of their art through critiques, demonstrations, and workshops. Artists of different mediums give valuable feedback that will stem from their various backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the midst of a climate that commoditizes art and music, it is important to create a network of individuals who can hold each other accountable to their ethical standards of making art. This community will facilitate growth outside of what could be attained independently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To work with local communities to establish a connecting point for the next generation to engage with art in a variety of mediums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who are selected to participate in our first magazine will be invited to the release party in New York City.
