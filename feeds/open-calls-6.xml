Successful proposals may be partially funded in accordance with exhibition needs and available funds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The String Room Gallery serves as the primary exhibition venue for Wells College, a small, private liberal arts institution in the Fingerlakes region of New York. With 1600 sq feet of space, track and natural lighting, and charismatic architectural details, the SRG is a versatile yet highly unique space that accommodates a range of practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful proposals will articulate clear and sophisticated conceptual grounding. As this exhibition space serves an academic institution, exhibitions will be evaluated, in part, on their relevance to, and potential for, enrichment of the school‚Äôs curriculum and pedagogical goals. The Wells experience prepares students to appreciate complexity and difference, to embrace new ways of knowing, to be creative, and to respond ethically to the interdependent worlds to which they belong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Priority will be given to those proposals received by August 1, 2019; proposals will be accepted until August 10, 2019.**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOLO &amp; COLLABORATIVE EXHIBITIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Email the following to  stringroomgallery@wells.edu, subject line: Solo/Collaborative Proposal: &lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;- Link to online portfolio or website, containing at least 10 works related to proposal.

From this unpromising beginning, the hands build up, tear down, start over, repeat again. And again. This process of making is an intimate act, a way of working toward discovery, where meaning beyond original inspiration is found. Nothing is permanent until the work is committed to the kiln.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wide range of artist‚Äôs voices here, the varied methods and styles, throws up a challenge. How do you negotiate a path through all the competing voices, complicated juxtapositions and visual fault lines? It takes time. Each work is clear, it only needs attention to be heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submissions due: Monday, August 26th, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please submit using the form link here: &lt;a href="https://form.jotform.com/trimistopheles/and-the-earth-shall-set-you-free-op" target="_blank"&gt;https://form.jotform.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/3ada7971-d0e7-41c0-8071-855083158668" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
