This year‚Äôs theme is roots, considering works that engage the term in relationship to culture, geography, identity, and community. This year's guest juror is interdisciplinary artist Tiffany Smith. We are seeking works from emerging and underrepresented artists 18 years+ who live in the United States and currently do not have gallery representation. Please read below for the show prompt, full eligibility, and more details, plus how to apply!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a juried show with a 1st place award of $300 USD plus a 6-month artist membership with us at PARADICE PALASE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entry Fee: $15  |  $8 for Palase neighbors (see eligibility for details)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadline to Apply: Wednesday April 24th, 2019 at 11:59 pm EST&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibition Dates: May 31st - June 23rd, 2019*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application &amp; details: www.paradicepalase.com/opencall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prompt: &lt;br/&gt;PARADICE PALASE is seeking artwork that responds to this year‚Äôs theme of roots, engaging audiences through topics of personal and geographic history, nature, or the environment. To put down roots is a common American expression that directly relates the long-term growth and stability of plants to the same long-term development of human habitats. With a multitude of insinuations, it‚Äôs a concept with that is being increasingly challenged in our current sociopolitical global economy. We chose this theme to bring awareness to these faults and consider ways artists dissect this broad but impressionable word. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acceptable Artwork:&lt;br/&gt;Painting, photography, prints, works on paper, 3D sculpture, fiber arts, sound, and video. All works on paper (including photography) MUST be in a non-ornamental frame - either white, black, or light wood -  unless explicit reasoning as to otherwise can be presented. Explanation can only relate to the content or aesthetic of the work. Artwork must be no larger than 35‚Äù in any direction, no longer than 2 min in length, and weigh no more than 20 lbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About PARADICE PALASE:&lt;br/&gt;We are a project space in Brooklyn, NY that confronts the limitations of the art world by creating a self sustaining, community-minded and inclusive space. We are dedicated to furthering the development of artists and building a symbiotic network of patrons and creators. We create accessibility in the arts by offering affordable artwork, monthly programs, and membership benefits to our community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Guest Juror:&lt;br/&gt;Tiffany Smith is an interdisciplinary artist from the Caribbean diaspora, working in photography, video, installation, and design. Using plant matter, design and home decor elements, pattern, and costuming as cultural signifiers, Smith creates photographic portraits, site responsive installations, user engaged experiences, and assemblages focused on identity, representation, cultural ambiguity, and displacement. Visual references from an array of multi-cultural influences, derived from her upbringing between Miami, Florida, Nassau, Bahamas, and Jamaica inform constructed environments that serve to articulate cultural subjectivities that oscillate between visitor and native roles. Smith‚Äôs practice centers on what forms and defines communities of people color, in particular; how they are identified and represented, and how they endure. She is a recipient of the 2018 NYFA Fellowship Award and the Bronx En Foco photography award. She has collaborated with non-profit organizations such as Recess Art and is a faculty member teaching photography at SVA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eligibility:&lt;br/&gt;Artists 18 years and older living and working within the United States who do not have gallery representation are welcome to apply. Artworks must be an original work produced by the artist applying and must have been completed within the last 5 years.
