Thanks to the hidden connections of ANIMA MUNDI, all the ecosystems of the Earth, before and after the appearance of the mankind, found their equilibrium, their ways to live and to develop themselves, to transform and to evolve. All the beings of the planet, plants, minerals, animals are permeated by a secret force that has always stimulated the human thought and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The festival aims to discover these multiple forms of hidden connections between the soul and the body, the mankind and the natural elements, the natural spaces and the cities. We invite artists to show their reflections about the various ways in which the ANIMA MUNDI expresses the relationships among all the existing entities and the natural and cultural systems, and to represent by their artistic works the processes of the evolution of the world in which we all live. Artists, designers and architects are invited to talk about ANIMA MUNDI through photo reportage of cities, hidden places, photographic documentaries, personal experiences, presenting their works of photography, painting, sculpture/installation, design and architecture, video-art and live performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITSLIQUID Group will begin a charity initiative aimed to support some of the most important no-profit organizations that are internationally involved in the environmental protection, such as United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, One Tree Planted, The Ocean Cleanup and Plastic Oceans. Indeed, they will have some interesting talks during CONSCIOUSNESS and VISIONS, the following ANIMA MUNDI‚Äôs appointments. This choice comes from the essence of ANIMA MUNDI in which everything is related to the living entities of the planet.

Proposals from solo shows all the way to larger group exhibitions will be considered.
