Children, who are more in touch with their senses, are attuned to what nature has to teach them.  Let's follow them: they are harbingers. Yoga, meditation, rites of passage... They use all that is available to them in seeking the right rhythm, in cultivating the kind of benevolence that gives meaning to one‚Äôs presence in the world.  This takes the form of a daily commitment, of maieutic engagement. In the wake of Timoci Naulusala or Greta Thunberg and other budding activists, they are brimming with good ideas to change our modes of life: they plant trees, cultivate vegetable gardens in cities, recycle garbage, make objects from recycled materials, organize pottery classes to reconnect with the earth and with others. In doing so, they also undergo a metamorphosis and set out to meet their true selves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key words: Sustainability and circular economy activism, common sense, poetic workwear&lt;br/&gt;Key pieces: Simple, practical garments with refined details, overalls, cotton seersucker smocks, knit rompers&lt;br/&gt;Fabrics: bamboo viscose, natural materials, washed linens, open stitch mesh, handmade knitwear&lt;br/&gt;Prints: wildflowers, dry vegetation, fruits from the orchard, positive symbols, talismans&lt;br/&gt;Colors: Warm, earthy and vegetable, half-shades, lighted by a buttercup yellow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#2 FANTASIA &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why not reach out for that hand and join the dance!&lt;br/&gt;You find yourself in a teeming phantasmagoria peopled with strange, half animal, half human creatures... A poetic and joyful fantasy where all wear masks, where optical illusions reign. In a setting somewhere between inextricable jungle and imaginary architectures, one camouflages or presents oneself with panache. Behind every door, a surprise! All possibles are open: one can don any costume, live in different skins, and reinvent oneself to the whim of nested identities. Therein resides the whole magic of childhood... But is it a dream or simply the carnival of life that marches in front of your astonished eyes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key words: fantasy, graphic and playful cuts, optical illusions, hidden details, color blocks, gathers, ruches, giant flounces&lt;br/&gt;Key pieces: tulle overdresses, tops and dresses with oversized sleeves, smocked shorts&lt;br/&gt;Fabrics: fluid jerseys, supple satins, tulle, textured knits&lt;br/&gt;Prints: extraordinary worlds, fairytales and legends, terrestrial and aquatic animals, strange plants, surreal collages, free forms, neo camo&lt;br/&gt;Colors: extraordinary multicolor plumages and bursts of exotic flowers, a kaki beauty treatment and deep jungle off-black&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRESS START&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accustomed to instant communication and to open source information, the new urban generation seems to live accelerated lives. These 3.0 kids oscillate between reality and virtuality, between the physical and digital realms, mixing them with humor and great agility. Without judgment or self-consciousness they make an instinctive synthesis of them, guided by whatever gives them emotions. Movement: it is their watchword. In this unprecedented adventure, they unpack both future and heritage with the same appetite and appropriate both with spontaneity. An urban and forward-looking theme, tinted with retro-tech nostalgia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key words: digital world, new technologies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented realities, urban board sports, street-sport-vintage mix &amp; match &lt;br/&gt;Key pieces: jackets or tracksuit bottoms mixed with urban or couture pieces, vintage print T-shirts, cycling shorts, semi-transparent windbreakers, fishnet shorts and skirts, emblazoned sweaters, casual swimsuits, visors, collectors‚Äô sneakers &lt;br/&gt;Fabrics: washed denims, jerseys, duffels, technical fabrics, metallic, lycras, featherweight nylons, PVC, waterproof surfaces&lt;br/&gt;Prints: retro-tech videogames, sports jerseys inspiration, repeat logos, graffiti with edgy messages, 50s &amp; 60s cartoons, tie &amp; dye total look &lt;br/&gt;Colors : cement gray and neutral colors that look machine-processed, lifted by a 70s orange and neons that propel the brand into the future!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please contact us with the following...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Your website which should have a CV AND images of your work&lt;br/&gt;- A brief explanation of how you feel your work relates to one of the themes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will then contact you to submit a formal proposal in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/bcc094a7-1ffb-4483-8364-a9fa6fe59ad2" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>43f492b3-03fc-4671-92b9-9491a7226d29</id><title>5/23 - INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR ART, ArtMaze Magazine Summer Edition: Issue 13</title><updated>2019-04-26T11:16:13.538906+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Art Maze Magazine&lt;br/&gt;üìç  , United Kingdom&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 05/23/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $30.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://artmazemag.com/call-for-art/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art Maze Magazine is an independent artist-run and ad-free international print and online publication dedicated to showcasing and promoting experimental and progressive contemporary art, which reflects modern society and its environment, provokes conversation and action; fosters innovation and diversity of mediums which make today‚Äôs art scene so intriguing and versatile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY: Artists are welcome to submit works in any medium: painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, photography, textile, installation, mixed media, digital, film (only jpg + link to video) etc. All visual art mediums are welcome.&lt;br/&gt;Artists or any art organisations on behalf of artists from all countries are welcome to submit their works for consideration.&lt;br/&gt;Each submitted artist, wether selected for a publication or not, will receive a digital copy of the magazine's issue which he/she applied for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEADLINE: May 23rd, 2019 (12:00 AM, midnight: end of the day 23rd May - Eastern Standard Time)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUEST CURATOR: Chris Sharp, writer and independent curator based in Mexico City, co-founder of Lulu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO APPLY: www.artmazemag.com/call-for-art&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DISTRIBUTION: Physical and digital copies of ArtMaze Mag are distributed worldwide via bookshops, galleries and online.
