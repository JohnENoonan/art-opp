Helfand Senior Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Marchesano has served as Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Getty Research Institute (GRI) in Los Angeles since 2002. After completing a BA with honors in the Visual Arts from the University of Western Ontario in 1987, Marchesano received an MA (1990) and PhD (2001) in the History of Art from Cornell University. Dr. Marchesano has written and lectured on topics ranging from antiquarianism in the Renaissance and Baroque and French prints from the period of the Revolution to the end of the Bourbon Restoration to the graphic work of the German artist K√§the Kollwitz. Much of his scholarship has focused on the history of printmaking in France from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, and for these contributions the French government this year bestowed upon him the honor of Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres (Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters).&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;QUESTIONS?
