In simpler terms, light gives life; under certain circumstances light also facilitates destruction. Capturing light in visual terms has always been a crucial element in traditional painting. With multi-media, installation, and conceptual-based artwork, light takes on an equally important role for the artist.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jurors for the ‚ÄúLight‚Äù show are Lauren Hirshfield and Kat Ryals, &lt;br/&gt;Co-Directors of Paradice Palase in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JURORS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lauren Hirshfield is an independent curator and artist living and working in NYC. She received a BFA in painting, arts management and art history from SUNY Purchase. Over the past five years she has freelanced as an arts administrator, assistant, and curator for organizations such as Superchief Gallery, 4Heads/Portal, POWRPLNT and ArtMoney. Her curatorial practice is fueled by the ephemeral, the ethereal and the tactile. She is interested in further democratizing the art world and strives to consider accessible ways the public can engage with art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kat Ryals is an artist, curator and photographer based in Brooklyn, NY. She received a BFA in photography in 2010 from Savannah College of Art and Design, and an MFA in Visual Art and Museum Education from Brooklyn College. She has worked in the education department of several NYC museums and non-profits, including the Rubin Museum, the Museum of Arts and Design, and ArtsConnection. Ryals has shown her work nationally, and was included in recent group exhibitions with the Holocenter on Governor‚Äôs Island, Temporary Storage Gallery at Brooklyn Fireproof, and the Wassaic Project. She was a Fellow at Vermont Studio Center in January 2018, and a resident at the Wassaic Project in January 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;440 Gallery is an artist-run space in Park Slope, Brooklyn, dedicated to the creation, exhibition and sale of a wide range of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY:&lt;br/&gt;Open to U.S. resident artists at least 18 yrs. old.
