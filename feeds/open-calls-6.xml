With a focus on mentorship, professional development, and hands-on training, the cohort works collaboratively to cultivate their practices within the context of New Haven‚Äôs creative community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NXTHVN team, with Deborah Berke Partners, has designed a unique shared environment‚Äîwithin a state-of-the-art facility‚Äîwhere artists, curators and the local community converge to make art, exchange ideas, and extend their networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NXTHVN‚Äôs comprehensive, year-long Fellowships provide dedicated work space, a generous stipend, a rigorous professional development curriculum, and ongoing mentorship opportunities for early-career artists and curators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples of our workshops and seminars include: Strategic Planning, Money Management, Contracts (Art and Law), Online Portfolio Development, Visiting Curator Discussions and Critiques, Professional Artist Talks, and Gallery and Collection Tours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NXTHVN‚Äôs unique pedagogy focuses on both the theoretical and practical components of establishing and nurturing a sustainable art practice. Our curriculum features bi-monthly workshops and seminars led by esteemed industry leaders and visiting lecturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to active participation in cohort-building activities, each fellow mentors a local high school student through our Apprenticeship Program to ensure the next generation of talent is given a chance to excel in the arts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* For more info on the Studio Fellowship or to apply, click here. &lt;br/&gt;** For more info on the Curatorial Fellowship or to apply, click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLICATION DEADLINE: NXTHVN welcomes submissions on a rolling basis each year from mid-May until midnight (EST), the eve of July 31st.
