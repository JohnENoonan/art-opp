It is time to make new memories and new histories, while revisiting and reevaluating old ones; It is time to start a new dialogue about the state of photography and it‚Äôs social, cultural and political effects in our society; it is time to give back to the photographic community but also the region; it is time for you to join us! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For our an inaugural Biennial we are grateful to have Andrew L. Moore as competition juror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are honored to collaborate with the Sordoni Gallery at Wilkes University, in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., where the Biennial will be held from August 27th to October 5h of 2019.

The exhibition will be sited in the boat basin adjacent to the Museum, located at Penn‚Äôs Landing on the Delaware River in Philadelphia and will run from October 11 ‚Äì November 30, 2019. The intent of the exhibition is to unite art with the river, and with the Museum‚Äôs mission and programming.  Five juried artists, along with five invited artists previously selected, will interpret the river and how it affects, and is affected by, human and natural history; human and natural migrations; climate change and the environment; economic development; and political currents. The geographic focus of the show is on the Americas and we are seeking artists from Mexico, South and Central America, and Canada, along with artists from the US and its territories. The jurors will be Nato Thompson, and Teresa Jaynes. The exhibition is also co-sponsored by the Dina Wind Art Foundation. Accepted artists will receive a $2,000 honorarium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information and how to apply, go to www.philaflow.org.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/b5894a3b-52c1-4735-b2ab-9ae7eaf56fdc" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>baf7223d-18ff-4d2c-8ae1-bf0e8a9290f7</id><title>3/22 - Open Call for Solo Exhibitions and Curatorial Projects</title><updated>2019-02-13T23:48:28.520896+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CUE Art Foundation&lt;br/&gt;üìç New York, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 03/22/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $10.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://cueartfoundation.org"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUE‚Äôs Open Calls provide artists and emerging curators the opportunity and necessary resources to realize an exhibition at CUE‚Äôs storefront gallery in East Chelsea, New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, a panel of established artists and curators select two solo exhibitions and one curatorial project to be realized at CUE.
