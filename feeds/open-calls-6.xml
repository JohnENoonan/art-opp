In the contemporary art world, the notion that ‚Äúbigger is better‚Äù is everywhere. From massive sculptural installations to giant canvases, the small, delicate, and pared down seem to have little place. Against such an idea, this show asks artists to go in the opposite direction and think about the intimacy and beauty of art that explores space, color, and form on a miniature scale. Site:Brooklyn is looking for works across all mediums ‚Äî painting, photography, drawing, sculpture, video, and multimedia. Our goal is to exhibit a wide array of work, truly representing the expansive world of small art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Heather Darcy Bhandari is an independent curator, adjunct lecturer at Brown University, and a consultant to several for-profit and nonprofit arts institutions. The second edition of her book, ART/WORK, was published by Simon and Schuster. She is on the board of directors of visual arts at Art Omi and the advisory boards of artfcity and Trestle Gallery in Brooklyn. From 2000 to 2016 she was a director of Mixed Greens, a commercial gallery where she curated over one hundred exhibitions while managing a roster of nearly two-dozen emerging to mid-career artists.
