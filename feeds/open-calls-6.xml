This 13th installment of the Master Pieces project will continue to reveal the intensity and professionalism of students working towards their terminal academic degree in the field of art or design. Often the most exceptional work comes out of these artists‚Äô immersion in their culture of study and intellectual pursuit. Manifest‚Äôs goal, therefore, is to select works that set the standard of quality that the artist is expected to maintain throughout his or her professional career and justify the degree of Master. The full-color hardcover Manifest Exhibition Annual publication, a 'yearbook' for the season, will serve as a visual documentation of these artists‚Äô own benchmarks for years to come. ‚Ä®&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to THREE of Manifest's exhibit spaces will be devoted to the Master Pieces 13 exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospects or enter work visit &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org/masterpieces." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Email questions to info@manifestgallery.org.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/d954d03b-29c4-426d-ba20-5e54e73d83d5" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>12b531ac-ec5c-4ba1-9ddc-cbcd67810f86</id><title>5/15 - ArtWorks Call to Artists!</title><updated>2019-04-05T11:15:42.693074+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ArtWorks, The Naomi Cohain Foundation&lt;br/&gt;üìç Englewood, NJ, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 05/15/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.artworksfoundation.org"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello from ArtWorks,&lt;br/&gt;I am writing to you to see if you would be willing to donate a 10 x 10 inch unframed work on paper for our upcoming Square Fair event on June 6th at the White Space Gallery, 555 W. 25th St., NYC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ArtWorks, is a not-for-profit organization that brings artists and art supplies to children in our 50 hospitals in New York and New Jersey.
