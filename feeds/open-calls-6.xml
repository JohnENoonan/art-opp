In addition to Johnson‚Äôs and Rivera‚Äôs work and advocacy for LGBTQ, homeless, and HIV positive youth - and particularly young people of color who were marginalized by broader LGBTQ rights efforts in ‚ÄúGay Liberation‚Äù - they were also pioneers in early efforts to further disability justice efforts, particularly around ensuring meaningful access to affirming healthcare for all people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RFP, BUDGET and PROCESS&lt;br/&gt;Professional visual artists or artist teams, working in any and all media, legally authorized to work in the U.S., and who are at least 18 years of age, are eligible to submit a Request for Qualifications (RFP) to design the permanent public artwork for Marsha P.

NYCx3 is a revolutionary new art fair concept built in harmony with lower Manhattan‚Äôs high-roller real estate market. Instead of one five-day fair, we‚Äôre programming three consecutive fairs in a strategic lower Manhattan locale next spring.

In keeping with the themed program, each fair will be limited to no more than 60 exhibitors for a highly curated experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Superfine! has been a life-changing experience that throttled my career and created so many new relationships with artists, collectors, curators, galleries and journalists that I still benefit from to this day."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Sean Christopher Ward, exhibiting artist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYCx1: (wo)man | 4.22-4.26.2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The female perspective arrives at the forefront in the fair that launches NYCx3, with a focus on women artists taking their art to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYCx2: myth | 4.29-5.2.2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrealist ideas and modern mythology provide the backdrop for a diverse fair comprised of artists at the cutting edge of emerging contemporary art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYCx3: Magick | 5.5-5.9.2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A celebration of all things queer: Magick highlights LGBTQI+ and ally artists representing the queer global experience across a broad range of styles and media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A whole year of exhibitions in a weekend.&lt;br/&gt;- Connect with 5-7,000 motivated, art-hungry New Yorkers during each five day fair.&lt;br/&gt;- ~25% of our visitors make a significant ($100-$2,500+) art purchase.&lt;br/&gt;- More than 50% of our exhibiting artists receive major media coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make art.

From the start, we caught flack from the art establishment when we broke down barriers and opened the gates to everyone from serious long-time art collectors to people who just love art and never thought they‚Äôd collect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it turned out, nobody cared about the art world and their politics. Our open and transparent approach worked: imaginations have been sparked and countless new collections have been jump-started at Superfine! fairs as we continue to spread our message of a more inclusive art market across the country. Since 2015, we‚Äôve had one goal: produce badass, expertly curated art shows where √ºber-talented, diverse global artists meet their new fans in iconic locations across the US and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more: &lt;a href="https://superfine.world/before-you-apply" target="_blank"&gt;https://superfine.world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibit in NYC: &lt;a href="https://superfine.world/exhibit-nyc" target="_blank"&gt;https://superfine.world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2XcyJkv" target="_blank"&gt;https://bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/ecd24700-e011-4da0-9b14-b26a6ae12162" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
