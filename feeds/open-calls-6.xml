The independently driven atmosphere and communal environment encourage creative growth, experimentation, confrontation of challenges, and cultivation of new ideas. To date, nearly 900 artists have participated in the residency program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bemis offers artists-in-residence unmatched technical guidance, access to interns, and an established network of resources. Participants have the opportunity to create networks, collaborate, and share their work with fellow artists-in-residence, organizational partners, and the public. Bemis Center is also currently building an alumni program that will further extend ongoing artist support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STUDIOS AND FACILITIES&lt;br/&gt;Located in downtown Omaha‚Äôs historic Old Market, Bemis Center's campus accommodates a broad range of artistic activity. Selected artists-in-residence enjoy generous sized, private live/work studios complete with a kitchen and bathroom and have 24-hour access to expansive installation and production spaces within Bemis Center‚Äôs 110,000 square foot main facility and the Okada Sculpture &amp; Ceramics Facility, a 9,000 square foot large-scale sculpture fabrication space and workshop. A Bemis residency also includes complimentary laundry facilities, utilities, wifi, and access to an on-site research library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STIPENDS&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-based artists-in-residence receive a $1,000 USD monthly stipend and an additional $750 USD travel stipend. Due to the limitations of B2 visas (touring/visiting), international artists-in-residence are eligible to receive reimbursement of qualified expenses, such as airfare, ground transportation, and meals. Bemis Center is not responsible for organizing artist‚Äôs travel to Omaha to attend the residency. Additional stipends for studio supplies or materials are not available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY&lt;br/&gt;Bemis residency opportunities are open to national and international artists 21+ years of age showing a strong professional working history. A variety of disciplines are accepted including, but not limited to, visual arts, media/new genre, performance, architecture, film/video, literature, interdisciplinary arts, music composition, and choreography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bemis residency alumni are allowed to re-apply after a five-year hiatus from the program. Alumni seeking residency must submit a complete application including recent work samples and current resume. Preference may be given to applicants who have not previously attended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists enrolled in an academic program during the time of the residency opportunity are not eligible to apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small collaborative groups are eligible to apply. Please note, if selected, Bemis Center is only able to accommodate two members of a collaborative group to attend the residency and live on-site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bemis welcomes internationally based artists to apply. Working knowledge of English is helpful for international artists as an interpreter will not be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for all persons regardless of race, sex, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and disability. For special needs or questions about accessibility, please contact the Residency Program Manager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPECTATIONS&lt;br/&gt;Artists are invited to participate in at least one opportunity for public presentation, such as our public Open House / Open Studios. This is a process-based residency; there is no expectation or promise of an exhibition in our first-floor galleries. Selected artists must attend a minimum of eight consecutive weeks to receive the award. Artists are not able to defer or reschedule if unable to attend the residency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEES&lt;br/&gt;A $40 USD non-refundable application fee is due at the time of submitting an application through SlideRoom paid via credit card or by PayPal. Submission of completed applications is only accepted online through bemis.slideroom.com. Fees related to visa processes or passport acquisition are the responsibility of the awarded artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS&lt;br/&gt;SlideRoom will confirm receipt of your submitted application. Residency applications are reviewed by a rotating panel comprised of artists and arts professionals, such as curators, academics, and/or critics. The application review process consists of an online review followed by an on-site panel meeting. The review process takes 12‚Äì14 weeks from the application deadline. Notifications to all applicants will be sent via email after the selection panel has made its final decision. If an artist is selected for more than one session, the artist will select one session to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEADLINE: August 31, 2019 | 11:59pm CST &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notifications to all applicants will be made via email on December 31, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REQUIRED APPLICATION MATERIALS&lt;br/&gt;-Your website&lt;br/&gt;-Current phone number&lt;br/&gt;-Current email&lt;br/&gt;-Current ZIP code&lt;br/&gt;-Artistic Discipline&lt;br/&gt;-Are you a collaborative?&lt;br/&gt;-Date of Birth&lt;br/&gt;-A brief statement about your creative and intellectual interests and description of how you anticipate using the time and space, e.g. working on current projects, conducting research, reading, writing, etc., if you are selected for a residency.
