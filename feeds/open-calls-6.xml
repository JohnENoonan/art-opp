The program launched as a new chapter in our commitment to quality craftsmanship and the communities where we work. West Elm LOCAL is all about supporting domestic manufacturing and stimulating local economies by tapping into the maker movement - supporting makers, artists and designers right in our own backyards.&lt;br/&gt;By creating a locally designed, locally made, locally sourced assortment in each of our stores, we‚Äôre establishing West Elm as an active community hub that offers a unique shopping experience.
