NYCx3 is a revolutionary new art fair concept built in harmony with lower Manhattan‚Äôs high-roller real estate market. Instead of one five-day fair, we‚Äôre programming three consecutive fairs in a strategic lower Manhattan locale next spring. The triple focus on women artists, contemporary surrealists, and LGBTQI+ artists plays out in the overarching themes: (wo)man, myth, and Magick. In keeping with the themed program, each fair will be limited to no more than 60 exhibitors for a highly curated experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Superfine! has been a life-changing experience that throttled my career and created so many new relationships with artists, collectors, curators, galleries and journalists that I still benefit from to this day."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Sean Christopher Ward, exhibiting artist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYCx1: (wo)man | 4.22-4.26.2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The female perspective arrives at the forefront in the fair that launches NYCx3, with a focus on women artists taking their art to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYCx2: myth | 4.29-5.2.2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrealist ideas and modern mythology provide the backdrop for a diverse fair comprised of artists at the cutting edge of emerging contemporary art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYCx3: Magick | 5.5-5.9.2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A celebration of all things queer: Magick highlights LGBTQI+ and ally artists representing the queer global experience across a broad range of styles and media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A whole year of exhibitions in a weekend.&lt;br/&gt;- Connect with 5-7,000 motivated, art-hungry New Yorkers during each five day fair.&lt;br/&gt;- ~25% of our visitors make a significant ($100-$2,500+) art purchase.&lt;br/&gt;- More than 50% of our exhibiting artists receive major media coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make art.

From the start, we caught flack from the art establishment when we broke down barriers and opened the gates to everyone from serious long-time art collectors to people who just love art and never thought they‚Äôd collect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it turned out, nobody cared about the art world and their politics. Our open and transparent approach worked: imaginations have been sparked and countless new collections have been jump-started at Superfine! fairs as we continue to spread our message of a more inclusive art market across the country. Since 2015, we‚Äôve had one goal: produce badass, expertly curated art shows where √ºber-talented, diverse global artists meet their new fans in iconic locations across the US and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more: &lt;a href="https://superfine.world/before-you-apply" target="_blank"&gt;https://superfine.world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibit in NYC: &lt;a href="https://superfine.world/exhibit-nyc" target="_blank"&gt;https://superfine.world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2XcyJkv" target="_blank"&gt;https://bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/ecd24700-e011-4da0-9b14-b26a6ae12162" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
