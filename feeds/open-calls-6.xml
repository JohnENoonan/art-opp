You might focus on, but are by no means limited to, personal connections with animals, the use of animal materials in art, how animals represent social, political, and aesthetic ideas, and how artists use animals in imaginative or formally innovative ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Alina Cohen is a staff writer at Artsy.
