Multiple price options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As artists, most of us find our voices through examining similar ideas over time.  Ultimately, these become our ‚Äúthematic materials‚Äù.  Upstream Gallery invites artists working on paper or making paper based constructions to submit work from their own practice that speak to the idea of theme and variation for our 7th Annual Juried PaperWorks exhibition.  The exhibition will be at Upstream Gallery, Hastings on Hudson, NY from June 27th to July 28th, 2019. Reception: Sunday, June 30th 2-5 pm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eligible Work: Artists are invited to submit 2-D or 3-D work that is primarily paper based.
