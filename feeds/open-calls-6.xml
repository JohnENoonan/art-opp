This exhibit invites artists to submit works that highlight the unconventional, the authentic, and the self-taught. What materials and perspectives are artists exploring? How are artists blurring the lines between fine and folk, mainstream and outsider?  What cultural traditions, personal histories, or social commentaries inspire their work? What identities and issues are finding a voice? How does this work challenge our ideas and address the human condition? These and other ideas and expressions will find a home in this exciting new exhibit opportunity. All media welcome; small to large-scale; indoor and outdoor. Cash awards to be presented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juror:  to be announced; to be drawn from the Smithsonian Institution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annmarie Sculpture Garden &amp; Arts Center, In Association with the Smithsonian Institution&lt;br/&gt;13470 Dowell Road/99, P.O.
