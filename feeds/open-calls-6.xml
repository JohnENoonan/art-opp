Set within a derelict industrial Park, PADA is a studio provider, international residency and gallery promoting interaction between national and international artists. Both practicing artists, Tim and Diana set up PADA with the aim of creating a unique resource for artists, to provide excellent studios and fabrication facilities alongside the opportunity to exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having both graduated with BA Hons they have worked in the London art scene for the last 15 years and gained a wealth of experience that they bring to this new project in Lisbon. In this time they have worked for artists such as Damien Hirst, Raqib Shaw and Julian Opie, galleries Alison Jacques and Hauser and Wirth as well as institutions including The Tate, ICA and BFI. The knowledge from assisting and working with these established and well known artists, galleries and institutions informs PADA as a residency that encourages and supports artists development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As PADA they have curated exhibitions in London and Lisbon, the latest exhibition at AMAC in Lisbon, included 40 artists over 4 galleries. 'Out of Office' curated by Alice Bonnot opens on the 11th May at PADA gallery and Recreational Grounds V opens on 17th May in the project space Tim still co curates in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael H.

Photographers at all experience levels are invited to submit work.  Artists selected as finalists will have their work exhibited (and available for purchase*) at Gallery19 for the month of July 2019. ** As competition judge, Ahmed Ozsever, artist and educator, will review all entries, select finalists, and announce the winner at an opening reception at Gallery19, on July 12th, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THEME: When Photography Ruled the Streets&lt;br/&gt;Gallery19 and juror Ahmed Ozever delve into the ever-changing world of street photography. There is no clear definition of street photography, but for this competition we will define street photography as the preservation of special moments of our time, in which artists make accessible to future generations.  These images are a documentation of who we are and where we have been.  Street photography fully immerses the viewer into a different time and experience.  Our hope is that artists of all levels will submit work that will tell stories like street photographers Vivian Maier and William Eggleston.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;THE PAYOFF:&lt;br/&gt;The winner of Gallery19 Meed3 will receive a solo show at Gallery19 for the month of August 2020.  The winner will also have a one-year contract with Gallery19, which includes exposure on the gallery‚Äôs website, ongoing multi-media, promotion, including social media, participation in gallery programming (openings, events, artist talks, etc.), and direct sales efforts.  In addition, Ahmed Ozsever will mentor the winner for a full year August 2019 through August 2020, by reviewing and evaluating work product, and assisting in development of a gallery-ready exhibition, all culminating in a solo exhibition at Gallery19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/709447bd-2beb-40f2-89af-fc4578068579" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
