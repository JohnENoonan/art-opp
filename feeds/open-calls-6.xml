We face increasingly complex local and global economies, war, environmental disasters and their resulting human migrations, alongside increasing concentrations of wealth and weakened worker protections. How, as artists and cultural producers, do we address the multiplicities of factors that impact our own survival? To what extent do contemporary technologies shape our work experiences? How are artists activating contemporary dialogues around labor history, interdependence, interconnectivity and communalism? The artworld has many historic examples of protests against unfair wages and unfair institutional representation that impact artist survival, including Art Workers Coalition, United Black Artists, Guerrilla Girls, Artists of Color Organization, the New York Artists Strike, Gran Fury and Act Up. More recent examples include W.A.G.E., Arts and Labor working group, Occupy Museums, MoMA Union Workers and protests demanding MoMA, the Whitney Museum and other large museums divest from the Prison Industry, Weapons Manufacturing and Big Pharma. What is the future of institutional critique and direct social action, and what can we glean from revisiting past Art and Labor movements?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Tool Book Project is seeking submissions for its third publication: Work Book. Work Book will be a risograph magazine featuring art and writing that responds to contemporary labor issues. Work Book seeks artwork and writing that address the labor of art, art production and artworld workers, as well as art and writing that broadly considers labor, leisure and its cultural intersections. Topics may include but are not limited to: prison labor, postwork imaginaries, cultural workers, invisible labor and emotional labor in light of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality and masculine/feminine spectrums, museum labor, institutional labor practices, exchange and gift economies, manual labor, collective work and living, financial precarity, retirement and aging, ableism and mental health in art, academic and other work worlds, marxism, techno-labor, unpaid domestic labor, performing leisure, labor and land, environmental collapse and the economy, de-colonialist action, and the labor of craft and studio practice. We are especially interested in projects that examine and re-center the histories and contemporary labor/leisure from a feminist perspective that addresses the intersectional and transnational complexity of race, ethnicity, gender, class, age, body size, disability, transgender and non-binary experience and sexual orientation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Tool Book Project is a semi-annual publication that showcases art, writing, dialogue and critical discourse from an international group of artists and cultural producers. Tool Book is also a platform for sharing resources via curated gallery shows, readings, roundtable discussions, and other public events. Sales from each publication are donated to specific social and environmental justice organizations, providing a mode of direct action for artists and writers to exchange ideas and affect positive social change.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Deadline: July 5, 2019 by 11:59pm&lt;br/&gt;Editing will begin soon and earlier submissions are encouraged&lt;br/&gt;‚Äã&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply here: &lt;a href="https://www.toolbookproject.org/submissions" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.toolbookproject.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact: toolbookproject@gmail.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission Requirements:&lt;br/&gt;-CV&lt;br/&gt;-Artist Bio (150 Words)&lt;br/&gt;-Project Description or Writing Abstract (350 Words)&lt;br/&gt;-5 Images and/or 3 time-based media clips (see details below)&lt;br/&gt;-OR-&lt;br/&gt;-Essay, Fiction, or Poetry up to 2,500 words (see details below&lt;br/&gt;‚Äã&lt;br/&gt;Project Description: This can be a project statement for the artwork you are submitting or an abstract for written submissions.

It was first presented in fall 2013 to inaugurate our expanded gallery. PAINTED 2019 will be the fourth biennial presentation of this international survey of contemporary painting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PAINTED is a gallery exhibit that calls for works of painting by artists around the world as they carry the tradition forward, or reform it for another day. This exhibit has no predefined expectation for type, style, or media of work to be considered or selected. Submissions can range from the most traditional to the most conceptual, abstract, or experimental, including those which push the boundaries of the common definition of what constitutes 'painting'. The only criteria beyond excellent quality is that works must in some way represent an approach to painting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$40 for up to FOUR entries submitted. $5 per each additional entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANNUAL CASH AWARD: The annual Manifest Grand Jury Prize will result in the awarding of one significant cash prize¬†($2500) to a single work selected as the 'best of the entire season'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospectus and entry form visit &lt;br/&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org/painted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/254b5b39-a546-407c-9150-f8548194d5d5" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
