This group exhibition will feature artworks depicting or inspired by California‚Äôs incredibly diverse, beautiful blooms. The Art of Wildflowers will be displayed in conjunction with the Garden‚Äôs California Wildflower Show. A tradition that has spanned nearly seventy years, the California Wildflower Show displays hundreds of field-collected wildflowers from multiple regions in Southern California. This year, the endless colors, shapes and fragrances of these intensely beautiful flowers will be paired with the artistic renderings and visions of artists that celebrate these blooms in their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Garden invites artists to submit their work for inclusion in The Art of Wildflowers group exhibition. The exhibition will run concurrently with The California Wildflower Show, April 13 - April 21 at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont, California. Works must be two-dimensional, ready to hang or install and either feature or be inspired by native California flowers. Two-dimensional works can be in any media, including drawing, painting, photography, sculptural reliefs, tile, glass or other materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Deadline: March 31, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Artwork Delivery Deadline: April 6, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Artwork Pickup Deadline: May 22, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Event Dates: April 13 - April 21, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Location: Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, 1500 N College Ave, Claremont CA 91711&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sales/Commissions: RSABG will retain a 50% commission on all exhibition sales which go to support the Garden and its programming.

For this show the jurors are prominent painter Eric Aho and acclaimed photographer Rachel Portesi, husband and wife, and photography has been added to the media accepted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERIC AHO is a prominent American painter known for his gestural, abstract paintings that evoke natural forms. He is represented by DC Moore Gallery in NYC. Born in Melrose, Massachusetts in 1966, he grew up in rural New Hampshire. After studying at the Central School of Art and Design in London, Aho received his BFA from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. Aho completed his graduate work at the Lahti Art Institute in Finland supported by a Fulbright Fellowship in 1991‚Äì92 and an American-Scandinavian Foundation grant in 1993. His works have been exhibited and collected widely in the United States and abroad and are included in the permanent collections of the Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, NH; Denver Art Museum, CO; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Hood Museum of Art, Hanover, NH; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; The Neuberger Museum of Art; and the New Britain Museum of American Art, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RACHEL PORTESI received a BA in Sociology and Photography from Marlboro College, VT. Her work as a black and white documentary photographer was complemented by the acquisition of her first Polaroid Land camera in 1991. Ten years later, with a move to New York City and no access to a darkroom, Portesi‚Äôs practice shifted exclusively to the immediacy of the Polaroid.  Working this way resulted in a body of work produced over more than two decades ending a few years ago when an older, even more finicky, and time-consuming way of making ‚Äúinstant pictures‚Äù caught Portesi‚Äôs attention‚Äîthe wet plate collodion tintype.  Her current projects in tintype are self reflective ‚ÄúHair Portraits.‚Äù Her photographs have been exhibited at various venues in New England and in New York. She works and lives with her family in Saxtons River, Vermont.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY Open to artists 18+years of age, living in the USA. Two-dimensional Media: original oils, acrylics, pastels, watercolors, prints, drawings, photography and mixed media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEES The fee is $40 for 1-3 works. $5 for each additional work up to 6 works total. Entry fees are paid through the entry form‚Äôs PayPal link, which accepts credit cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional submission requirements are available at&lt;br/&gt;www.bluemountaingallery.org/summer-juried-show-2019/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online submission only&lt;br/&gt;PROSPECTUS: &lt;a href="https://bluemountaingallery.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bmg-summer-juried-2019.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;https://bluemountaingallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INQUIRIES CONTACT: bluemountaingallery@verizon.net - 646.486.4730&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/da42ad36-2a58-4741-825d-08fb9aba767c" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
