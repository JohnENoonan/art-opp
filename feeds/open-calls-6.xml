Photographers at all experience levels are invited to submit work.  Artists selected as finalists will have their work exhibited (and available for purchase*) at Gallery19 for the month of July 2019. ** As competition judge, Ahmed Ozsever, artist and educator, will review all entries, select finalists, and announce the winner at an opening reception at Gallery19, on July 12th, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THEME: When Photography Ruled the Streets&lt;br/&gt;Gallery19 and juror Ahmed Ozever delve into the ever-changing world of street photography. There is no clear definition of street photography, but for this competition we will define street photography as the preservation of special moments of our time, in which artists make accessible to future generations.  These images are a documentation of who we are and where we have been.  Street photography fully immerses the viewer into a different time and experience.  Our hope is that artists of all levels will submit work that will tell stories like street photographers Vivian Maier and William Eggleston.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;THE PAYOFF:&lt;br/&gt;The winner of Gallery19 Meed3 will receive a solo show at Gallery19 for the month of August 2020.

In addition, Ahmed Ozsever will mentor the winner for a full year August 2019 through August 2020, by reviewing and evaluating work product, and assisting in development of a gallery-ready exhibition, all culminating in a solo exhibition at Gallery19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/709447bd-2beb-40f2-89af-fc4578068579" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>4af36470-2a41-40f8-8bb0-c46d02bbce6f</id><title>7/3 - Call for Artists for 106th Annual National Exhibition</title><updated>2019-05-07T08:16:30.035267+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Allied Artists of America&lt;br/&gt;üìç New York, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 07/03/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $55.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://alliedartistsofamerica.org/"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artists: Oil, Watermedia, Pastel, Graphics &amp; Sculpture  Allied Artists of America.
