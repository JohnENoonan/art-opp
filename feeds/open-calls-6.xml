The exhibit is open to submissions until April 28, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Definition of ‚ÄúIrl‚Äù:¬†Irl stands for ‚Äúin real life‚Äù. "Real life" is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the real world and fictional or idealized worlds, and in acting to distinguish between performers and the characters they portray. The phrase ‚Äúirl‚Äù emerged in the early days of the Internet when people saw a need to distinguish things that were happening online from things that were happening offline. As people found ways to present an alternate picture of themselves online, irl became a shorthand for distinguishing between how things appear online and how they are in reality. It can also be used to distinguish reality from something that happens in games, on social media, or on TV or in films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group exhibition, ‚ÄúIRL: Investigating Reality,‚Äù¬†curated by gallery director Indira Cesarine, will feature contemporary artists exploring what ‚ÄúIRL‚Äù means to them in today‚Äôs digital world. Artwork for IRL should conceptualize what ‚Äúin real life‚Äù means, and may present the mundanities of ‚Äúreal life‚Äù or explore the intersection of digital and physical worlds. Works may address concepts of ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù versus edited, retouched or fictitious realities with an emphasis on realism or "reality" as we know it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works can be in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, performance amongst others. All works must be created within the last 2 years, with a priority on new, previously unexhibited artworks. Art must be ready to hang or install. Artists may submit up to 5 works of art for consideration, which may include renderings or proposals of works to be created specifically for the exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE&lt;br/&gt;The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street.
