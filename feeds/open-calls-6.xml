Curtis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists are invited to submit works for a group exhibition of contemporary art inspired by the architecture of Louis Kahn and the idea of inversions.  The exhibition is organized by MW Projects, with support from the Consulate General of Estonia in New York, and will be held in New York City in Fall 2019.  The main exhibition will be presented at Gallery RIVAA on Roosevelt Island and will be complemented by an outdoor exhibition of Arne Maasik‚Äôs Kahn-related photographs in partnership with Four Freedoms Park and a weekend pop-up exhibition focused on performance in downtown Manhattan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born in Estonia in 1901, Louis Kahn was one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century.  His work includes the Salk Institute (La Jolla, CA), National Assembly Building (Dhaka, Bangladesh), Phillips Exeter Academy Library (Exeter, NH) and Four Freedoms Park (New York, NY).   Known for combining Modernism with the weight and dignity of ancient monuments, Kahn used simple shapes and simple materials to build preternaturally beautiful structures that sought to create transcendent experience.  He believed that structure, space and light must always be in harmony, and that it is through the material that we can understand the immaterial and universal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All art forms will be considered for the exhibition, including painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, music, performance art, dance and media art.  There are also opportunities for live performances during the run of the main exhibition and the pop-up exhibition.  Artists are encouraged to investigate the conceptual underpinnings of Kahn‚Äôs works and words, rather than using images of Kahn‚Äôs designs and buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All entries will be reviewed, selected and notified by Monday, September 9, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;Please see website for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details: www.MWprojects.art&lt;br/&gt;Application instructions: &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/inversionskahn" target="_blank"&gt;http://bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application: &lt;a href="https://mwprojects.typeform.com/to/DMmZdo" target="_blank"&gt;https://mwprojects.typeform.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Email: info@mwprojects.art&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/4484575b-509c-44e2-bad6-a6c30811641f" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>b7998912-306a-49e2-b5b4-ec15c4ff4083</id><title>6/7 - GET FEATURED in the next issue of Artqol Magazine 6th edition</title><updated>2019-05-21T11:16:48.987804+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Artqol&lt;br/&gt;üìç  , Netherlands&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Disciplines&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 06/07/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://www.artqol.com/magazine-call"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your art doesn't speak for itself, we help you to tell its story by writing about you and your artistic practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artqol magazine is a curated collection of stories behind artists and their works, promoting Artqol's contemporary artists and curator members, with focuses on conceptual, expressive, social, political and environmental art practices.
