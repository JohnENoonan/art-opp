WERQ is intended to celebrate bodies that labor, that do the work society can take for granted or simply chooses to ignore in order to queer office spaces. While we welcome submissions from all points of view, NOGO Arts encourages artists from under represented communities to submit work.  &lt;br/&gt;With WERQ, NOGO Arts seeks to queer a common workspace while recognizing the momentous 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. While Stonewall is a historical marker, it was not the first time queer people rose up to do the work of social justice, hence: We‚Äôve Been Doing This Our Whole Lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOGO Arts has its offices at the Playground Brooklyn, an independent coworking space in Gowanus. The Playground also is the home of Brooklyn Art Cluster‚Äôs new gallery space. Selected artists will have their work shown in the gallery which also serves as a common space for the Playground. Themes/topics could include (but are not limited to):&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Equal pay&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Equity and Inclusivity &lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Inclusivity&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	LGBTQ protection in the work place&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Queer Labor&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	In/Visibility of work &lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Play as work&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Work as subject&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Labor of art making&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Capitalism&lt;br/&gt;We are interested in curating an exhibit that crosses media and disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;The exhibit will include live performance twice during its run: at the opening night Friday June 7th and again on Wednesday June 19th.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOGO Arts is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and presenting work in the LGBTQ Arts and Humanities. NOGO Arts does not charge a submission fee. Artists will be expected to meet technical requirements as stated by the gallery, ensure delivery and pickup of artwork by agreed upon date, and attend the opening party or performance event (if they live locally). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOGO Arts, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization under the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested artists should go to www.NOGOArts.org/werqsubmission to submit work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact Todd Coulter at todd@nogoarts.org with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/66ad27f9-149d-490e-803d-861a612b0e67" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>f11f8c9e-dbb4-4fc5-8593-2600b564b145</id><title>4/17 - 4 WEEKS LEFT TO APPLY: Superfine!

Superfine! NYC '19 applications close on Wednesday, April 17th, however applications are reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis. 80% of artist booths and 50% of gallery booths are already reserved by other cutting-edge leaders of the new contemporary movement, and all booths will likely be sold out before the application deadline. Here's what's still available:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GALLERIES:&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ 14 booths in our Gallery Pavilion ranging from 16 - 28 linear feet of wall ($4,000 - $7,000)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOLO ARTISTS:&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ 7 Elevate Booths: 12-foot artist booths; the fair's most popular size ($3,000)&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ 3 Immerse Booths: 16-foot artist booths for artists wishing to have a larger footprint in the fair ($4,000)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superfine! receives frequent and consistent media coverage in outlets like Washington Post, New York Post, and Artnet, and the fair holds the key to the growing, "maturing", and engaging young collector masses. About 20% of visitors make a significant purchase of at least $500, and 90% of past exhibitors report selling to almost exclusively new clients outside of their existing collector network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superfine! NYC will be hosted from May 1-5 on 14th Street in the Meatpacking District (at the foot of the bustling High Line Park). Superfine! is an art fair engineered for galleries who recognize a needed shift in the art market and for artists treating their talents as a serious art business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE FAIR:&lt;br/&gt;Superfine! on Artnet: &lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/partner-content/superfine-la" target="_blank"&gt;https://news.artnet.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superfine!

'Sanctuary' itself has a wide range of definitions: a place offering shelter, a sacred or consecrated place, a container of holy things, a refuge for humans or wildlife, and a place offering immunity from law. We are seeking works that broadly define 'Sanctuary.' Works that convey political activism, faith and religion, wildlife protections, and a place of refuge, peace and safety are welcome, as well as abstract works that express the meaning of 'Sanctuary.'

Economies of attention and dis-attention, click bait, cloud analytics, memes, social media and fake news have now taken center stage in the process of subjectivation and the interiorization of domination. Could the spreading wave of Populism worldwide be the result of forms of embodied and extended cognition linked to contemporary neoliberal apparatuses? The central thesis of this year‚Äôs program posits that these are the initial constituents and first signs of an impending crisis that define a later stage of cognitive capitalism. New technologies on the horizon, such as brain computer interfaces, cortical implants and optogenetics, provide an imminent threat and could create the core technologies that instigate, track, measure, and record the brains‚Äô capacities to generate electrical signals (or brain waves) during wake and sleep which then might be linked to the Internet and virtual platforms. Companies funded by DARPA, like Neuralink and Kernel, are at the forefront of these efforts to produce ‚Äútotal subsumption‚Äù. On the other hand, perhaps these new technologies will make brain power obsolete as humans are replaced by AI and robots and are no longer necessary for military regimes or physical and mental labor. As such, the nightmare of science fiction and right-leaning accelerationism might become reality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFSIA 2019 asks what effect these transformations might have on human consciousness and its various social and cultural expressions and permutations as defined in the fields of neuroaesthetics, psychology, politics, philosophy of mind, queer and gender studies, popular and visual culture, cultural and decolonial studies, art history, visual and sound art, film studies, as well as, sociology and economics. How might we together understand these changes in the context of artistic research programs that (already) use the lenses of post-humanism, transhumanism, and speculative materialism? Through discussions, workshops, deep readings and performative lectures, we aim to co-create new pathways of understanding and dissensus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FACULTY&lt;br/&gt;Claire Bishop, Patricia Clough, Suzanne Dikker, Coco Fusco, Agnieszka Kurant, Sanford Kwinter, Joseph E.

Please see our application for more information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT SFSIA&lt;br/&gt;Saas-Fee Summer Institute of Art (SFSIA) is a nomadic, intensive summer academy with shifting programs in contemporary critical theory.

In 2019, this additional program will be hosted by Performance Space New York. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Saas-Fee Summer Institute of Art was founded and is directed by Warren Neidich and is co-directed by Barry Schwabsky.
