The program will run from August to December 2019, and is open to performing artists working in music and composition, dance and choreography, performance art, and theater arts (acting, producing, directing), and writers including playwrights, storytellers, and poets, as well as those working in fiction and nonfiction. In bringing these two disciplines together, the program aims to nurture a productive environment for collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYFA‚Äôs Immigrant Artist Mentoring Program pairs immigrant artists working in all disciplines with artist mentors who provide one-on-one peer support, guiding them to achieve specific goals for their artistic practice and providing them with broader access to the New York cultural world and beyond through an exchange of ideas, resources, and experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most importantly, the mentoring program fosters a community, providing opportunities to connect with other immigrant artists through group meetings, peer learning, and informal gatherings that include alumni from 2007 to the present. Through access to other artists, arts professionals, and organizations, the program offers immigrant artists the opportunity to focus on their career goals while navigating the shared experience and challenges of being an immigrant artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYFA‚Äôs Cultural Partners for this program are: Cave Canem, Center for Traditional Music and Dance, Dance/NYC, Exploring the Metropolis, Gibney, Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning, Joe‚Äôs Pub, Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Poetry Society of America, and Word Up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Testimonials:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThe experience widened my network and strengthened my community. I met some of the best people through this program‚Äîeven when they were from different artistic backgrounds‚Äîand it encouraged me to be more open about my art form. The organizers were wonderful and extremely supportive throughout my process of reestablishing my place in this city, and I‚Äôm so glad I got to be a part of the program.‚Äù  - Samira Sadeque (IAP: Performing &amp; Literary Arts ‚Äô18), journalist and poet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúNYFA‚Äôs Immigrant Artist Mentoring Program was a great opportunity to connect with an emerging community of immigrant artists. It also provided me with the tools to understand the areas I had to work on to obtain more and better opportunities as an artist. The structure of the program was clear and effective. Among its most significant benefits was the individual feedback I received from my mentor and other participants. I started the program looking for resources to help produce my work as a choreographer, but I left with vastly more‚Ä¶‚Äú - Christopher N√∫√±ez (IAP: Performing &amp; Literary Arts ‚Äô18), choreographer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is made possible with the generous support of The Vilcek Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligibility:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚óè	Performing artists, including music and composition, dance and choreography, performance art, theater arts (acting, producing, directing), and writers (fiction, non-fiction, playwrights, poets, and storytellers).
