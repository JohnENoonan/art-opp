It is a chance to discover one‚Äôs artistic second wind, when powerful creative energy is released at the very time physical energy diminishes.

Artists are urged to consider the mental and physical aspects of this endeavor and must feel that they can safely participate. Dressing in layers of comfortable clothing is recommended.  The event is held in a public setting so that visitors may observe artists at work throughout the  24-hour marathon period. Participants are expected to spend most of the 24 hours in the museum drawing and taking frequent scheduled breaks. &lt;br/&gt;AWARDS:  Two cash prizes will be awarded on the morning of Saturday, April 6: the jury prize of $1000 and the people‚Äôs prize of $500. The people‚Äôs prize will be awarded on the basis of qualitative comments received by visitors to the marathon as well as statements posted on the Binghamton University Art Museum Facebook age. In addition to these prizes the Binghamton University Fine Art Society (BUFAS) will give a basket of art supplies to one artist demonstrating the most creative or  innovative approach to drawing.&lt;br/&gt;TIMELINE:  The competition will commence Friday, April 5 at 10:00 am. At the end of every hour there will be 15-minute break for the model and participants. Every four hours there will be a 30-minute break. An award ceremony will follow shortly after the competition concludes on Saturday, April 6 at 10:00 am. The drawings will remain on view in the museum through Tuesday, April 9.

FBI hate crime reports were up 17% in 2017, marking a rise for the third year in a row. FBI's statistics are an undercounted representation of hate crime trends and 2018 stats are due November of this year. In midst of the discordant political atmosphere, these statistics confirm what many of us have already felt and known: speech and acts of bias are rising around us. Puffin Cultural Forum‚Äôs  exhibition, "Measured Hate" seeks to take a focused look at the national and local climate behind the rise of hate and bias incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submission of artwork of all media will be accepted including 2 dimensional pieces, sculptures not exceeding 5 feet in any direction, video, etc. Most accepted works will be 2 dimensional pieces which can be displayed on our gallery walls not exceed 5 feet in height.
