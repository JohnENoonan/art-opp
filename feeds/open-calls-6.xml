For some, it means stripping away the visual irrelevancies of nature in order to explore different subjects, an exploration of the artist‚Äôs own imagination, or finding the essential qualities a form observed in the real world. The freedom of abstraction rests on a paradox: the liberation of non-objective art often meant the new focus on order, form, and purity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Julia Halperin is executive editor of artnet News, where she oversees editorial operations for the world‚Äôs most widely read art news site and manages a staff of editors and writers in London, Berlin, and New York.
