It was first presented in fall 2013 to inaugurate our expanded gallery. PAINTED 2019 will be the fourth biennial presentation of this international survey of contemporary painting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PAINTED is a gallery exhibit that calls for works of painting by artists around the world as they carry the tradition forward, or reform it for another day. This exhibit has no predefined expectation for type, style, or media of work to be considered or selected. Submissions can range from the most traditional to the most conceptual, abstract, or experimental, including those which push the boundaries of the common definition of what constitutes 'painting'. The only criteria beyond excellent quality is that works must in some way represent an approach to painting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$40 for up to FOUR entries submitted. $5 per each additional entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANNUAL CASH AWARD: The annual Manifest Grand Jury Prize will result in the awarding of one significant cash prize¬†($2500) to a single work selected as the 'best of the entire season'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospectus and entry form visit &lt;br/&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org/painted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/254b5b39-a546-407c-9150-f8548194d5d5" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
