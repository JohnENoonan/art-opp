Submit your work for the 2019 Portal: Governors Island (formerly Governors Island Art Fair) opening this September. Portal: GI - New York‚Äôs largest independent exhibition - will once again feature scores of artists of exceptional talent, and each will be awarded an exhibition room or large outdoor space in the historic and beautifully dilapidated buildings of Colonels Row. The lines between artwork and its environment are blurred across the lawns and landmark houses of bucolic Governors Island. Founded by 4heads, a group of New York artists, Portal: GI champions an art fair model that puts the artists first. &lt;br/&gt;Once selected by 4heads jury, your exhibition space is free. The entire massive event is free to the general public. And as an emerging or established artist, you are free to present your work, your way, at this acclaimed independent art fair in New York City. Because 4heads works hard to keep artists‚Äô costs to a bare minimum, gallery scouts, journalists and collectors know that this is where to find the freshest talent, and they come back every year to see what‚Äôs been discovered. Many past Portal/GIAF artists have launched their art careers here. We hope you can too. - 4heads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heads up! - 4heads is also seeking outdoor artists working in all disciplines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apply at: &lt;a href="https://4heads.slideroom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;https://4heads.slideroom.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Info at: &lt;a href="http://www.4heads.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.4heads.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2018 Video (this helps you understand our spaces): &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LrcQtWcB7Ks" target="_blank"&gt;https://youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadline for Submission: June 5, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Application Fee: $45  -  No Additional Charges&lt;br/&gt;Fair Dates: Every Weekend in September 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply at: &lt;a href="https://4heads.slideroom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;https://4heads.slideroom.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Info at: &lt;a href="http://www.4heads.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.4heads.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2018 Video (this helps you understand our spaces): &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LrcQtWcB7Ks" target="_blank"&gt;https://youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadline for Submission: June 5, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Application Fee: $45  -  No Additional Charges&lt;br/&gt;Fair Dates: Every Weekend in September 2019&lt;br/&gt;Contact Email for Questions: info@4heads.org&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/02b9219a-39c4-48dc-9674-70cf059f03c0" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>fbd6e705-6624-41a8-acc0-5b622a192945</id><title>7/31 - Create!
