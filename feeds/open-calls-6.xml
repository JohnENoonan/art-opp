We constantly seek out ways to deal with what we produce, consume, and discard. The aesthetic potential of trash is well established in artistic practice. It has had its place in avant-garde since the early twentieth century, when Marcel Duchamp introduced the idea of the readymade: discarded, modified works, remanufactured and displayed as an art. Site:Brooklyn is seeking artists whose practice continues to investigate the relationship between discarded materials and art. We are looking for works across all mediums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE JUROR:&lt;br/&gt;Jean Shin is nationally recognized for her monumental installations that transform everyday objects into elegant expressions of identity and community. Her work has been widely exhibited in over 150 major museums and cultural institutions, including solo exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE GALLERY:&lt;br/&gt;Site:Brooklyn Gallery located in Brooklyn, New York is dedicated to exhibiting the current practice of contemporary artists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;DATES:&lt;br/&gt;Call Announcement: July 23, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Final Submission Deadline: September 12, 2019 11:59 PM MT&lt;br/&gt;Notification Letter: September 21, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Gallery Exhibition: November 1‚Äì November 30, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Opening Reception: Friday, November 1, 2019 from 6-9 PM&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ELIGIBILITY:&lt;br/&gt;This is a juried exhibition for artists working in all materials and processes.
