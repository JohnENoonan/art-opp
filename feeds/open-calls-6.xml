You'll get an opportunity to submit this summer). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) An Open Call for Earth Day: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In honor of Earth Day and all things repurposed, we are pleased to announce artist Angelica Bergamini‚Äôs solo exhibition, ‚ÄúFrom the City to the Cosmos‚Äù which kicks off at the gallery on Earth Day - April 22nd!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save the Date for the Artist Reception: Friday, May 10th, 6-9pm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists based in New York City: we want all of your unwanted paper materials/discards for the show! Angelica will create collaborative paper sculptures from your donated paper scraps during the run of the exhibition. She will accept all forms of used, neglected or undesired paper: anything from your sketches and proofs to notes and failed drawings/paintings or any other paper product that you consider "garbage."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're accepting your paper donations from April 25th - 28th, 2019! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Our Spring Pop-up Exhibition "Heirloom": &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Floor Gallery is pleased to announce our spring open call for ‚ÄúHeirloom,‚Äù  a pop-up show in honor of the season and the significance of family! As defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary, an heirloom is: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1: a piece of property (such as a deed or charter) that descends to the heir as an inseparable part of an inheritance of real property&lt;br/&gt;2: something of special value handed down from one generation to another&lt;br/&gt;3: a variety of plant that has originated under cultivation and that has survived for several generations usually due to the efforts of private individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In true Ground Floor Gallery fashion, ‚ÄúHeirloom‚Äù is an extension of our mission to connect emerging artists to new art buyers while - in our small way - supporting a cause we deem urgent. Each original artwork will be sold for $220; all sales will be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity; and, in honor of election year and the prospect of new beginnings - $20.20 from each sale will benefit RAICES: (The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services) in their continued efforts to reunite immigrant families separated at the border. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission Deadline: Sunday, May 12th, 2019, 11:59am&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAVE THE DATE for the Opening Reception: Friday, May 17, 2019, 5-9pm &lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúHeirloom‚Äù will remain on view through Monday, May 20th, 2019. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two years ago, you all helped us raise over $1,000 for the Committee to Protect Journalists and we‚Äôre hoping your passion and sense of urgency to address this most pressing of issues resonates as strongly! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will accept all submissions by up to 75 New York City-based artists in response to this theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No phone calls.
