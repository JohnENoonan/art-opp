He kept it as a treasured object and it is displayed to this day on the second floor of The Edward Hopper House Museum and Study Center in Nyack, NY, his boyhood home. Hopper was fascinated by the wide variety of boats on the Hudson River and this considerable interest is evidenced in the many paintings and drawings he created that depict boats, the Hudson River and landscapes of the Hudson Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are calling on Artists to submit existing sculptures or new proposals for art works to be displayed in the newly reopened and renovated Outdoor Sculpture Garden. The theme of this outdoor exhibition&lt;br/&gt;is being coordinated in conjunction with an exhibition in the main gallery of Hopper House by Alastair Noble in which he will create a dynamic installation of paper origami boats containing poetic messages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are looking for work that relates to the themes of hidden messages, boats, the Hudson River or any other interpretation that is a compelling artistic statement and relates to the theme. All materials as well as installations are acceptable, but work must be suitable for display outdoors for a period of 4 months. &lt;br/&gt;Artists are responsible for delivery/ shipping of art work to Hopper House, 82 North Broadway, Nyack, NY. &lt;br/&gt;A small stipend may be available for accepted artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submission Requirements:&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Contact Information: Artist name, Address, Phone Number, Website&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Current CV&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	JPEG Images of Existing work  (300 DPI at least 1MB in Size), &lt;br/&gt;Files labelled: Artist Last Name_Artist First Name_Title_#&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	JPEG Images of artist rendering for new work proposals as well as some examples of previous work that illustrates quality of artist work or relationship to new work&lt;br/&gt;Files labelled: Artist Last Name_Artist First Name_Title_#&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	A corresponding image  list with Title, Materials, Dimensions and year completed (if applicable)&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	For existing work a brief description explaining the relevance to theme of exhibition&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	For new work, a brief description of the new work and relevance to theme&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Submissions can be made use the following link:  &lt;a href="http://www.edwardhopperhouse.org/exhibiting-at-edward-hopper-house.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.edwardhopperhouse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	For questions please contact Eric David Laxman:  eric@ericdavidlaxman.com &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT DATES:&lt;br/&gt;Submission Deadline: April 1, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Notification of Acceptance: April 15, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Installation of work:  May 27-31, 2019&lt;br/&gt;Opening Reception: June 13, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/dd88bdbe-4034-437c-9156-ff6899c033d1" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>483f4950-e780-491a-8a45-90511448e8e8</id><title>4/1 - Call for Proposals: Summer/Fall Exhibition at Opalka Gallery in Albany, NY</title><updated>2019-03-07T08:14:59.720871+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Opalka Gallery, Sage College of Albany&lt;br/&gt;üìç Albany, NY, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 04/01/2019 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://Opalka.sage.edu"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads. Pipes. Wires. Bureaucracies. These words describe infrastructure, the physical and metaphysical systems that surround us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-faux-structure, an ambitious indoor/outdoor exhibition scheduled for August ‚Äì October 2019, will investigate gender and identity as it relates to infrastructure. Who makes decisions related to infrastructure? Who is responsible for the labor? Who designs it?  Everyone uses and pays for infrastructure but is everyone represented in its planning, building, and oversight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exhibition opportunity is open to artists and non-artists to explore their definition of infrastructure, how it can be improved, who it serves, who it doesn‚Äôt serve, and who is left out altogether. We are looking for playful takes on the systems that surround us. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name In-"faux"-structure refers to false or erroneous meaning related to infrastructure, the ephemeral nature of building materials, and other ambiguities related to physical and social systems and their creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXHIBITION GOAL&lt;br/&gt;In-faux-structure will create an awareness of inequities related to infrastructure, its planning, its building, and its public face. The project will encourage dialogue between artists and collaborators and spark dialogues through exhibition-related events and community engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CALL FOR WORK&lt;br/&gt;In-faux-structure is open to those working in all media - for both new and existing work. Proposals for site-specific and related projects ‚Äî including projects outside the gallery and expanding into the community ‚Äî are encouraged. We welcome artists who wish to collaborate and will help you find the right person(s) with whom to collaborate. Collaborators  may include other artists, people working in the trades, engineers, architects, poets, social activists, etc. We can provide a layout of the space (indoor and outdoor) for artists to consider. Individual and collaborative proposals may respond to social, emotional, or physical issues related to infrastructure. We welcome humor, irony, and creative interpretations of the topic. Proposals may respond to the following or related ideas:&lt;br/&gt;- The planning of infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;- The naming of infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;- Connection (physical, social, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;- The relationship of power to gender, racial, or other identities&lt;br/&gt;- ‚ÄúFixing‚Äù problems related to structures&lt;br/&gt;- The maintenance of infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;- Erosion of infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;- Reimagining existing structures or networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: We have a shared Google doc for people would like to find collaborators.
