Set within a derelict industrial Park, PADA is a studio provider, international residency and gallery promoting interaction between national and international artists. Both practicing artists, Tim and Diana set up PADA with the aim of creating a unique resource for artists, to provide excellent studios and fabrication facilities alongside the opportunity to exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having both graduated with BA Hons they have worked in the London art scene for the last 15 years and gained a wealth of experience that they bring to this new project in Lisbon. In this time they have worked for artists such as Damien Hirst, Raqib Shaw and Julian Opie, galleries Alison Jacques and Hauser and Wirth as well as institutions including The Tate, ICA and BFI. The knowledge from assisting and working with these established and well known artists, galleries and institutions informs PADA as a residency that encourages and supports artists development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As PADA they have curated exhibitions in London and Lisbon, the latest exhibition at AMAC in Lisbon, included 40 artists over 4 galleries. 'Out of Office' curated by Alice Bonnot opens on the 11th May at PADA gallery and Recreational Grounds V opens on 17th May in the project space Tim still co curates in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael H.
