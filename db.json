To that end, DCLA embeds socially engaged artists in New York City municipal agencies in order to use creative, collaborative art practice to propose and implement creative solutions to pressing civic challenges.<br/><br/>Launched in 2015, PAIR takes its name and inspiration from the pioneering work of artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the first official artist in residence with the NYC Department of Sanitation (1977- present).  Since establishing the program, DCLA has embedded 10 artists in 8 agencies, including Tania Bruguera at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, The Lost Collective at the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh at the Commission on Human Rights, among others. For a full list of PAIRs to date, click here.  <br/><br/>All of the PAIR partnerships \u2013 some of which are still ongoing \u2013 vary greatly in concept, scope, duration, and populations engaged, and their successes are driven by the openness of the partner agencies and the artist-led, collaborative process that the PAIR program framework provides. <br/><br/>RESIDENCY STRUTURE, FEES, and MATERIALS<br/>PAIR residencies begin with a required half-day orientation session, which kicks off a three-month Research Phase.  This Phase is a time for the artist and agency to establish mutual trust through shared exposure to each other\u2019s work and process\u2014the artist shadows agency staff and attends meetings, trainings and site visits, and in turn the agency hosts an artist talk and visits the artist at their studio.  <br/><br/>The Research Phase ends with the artist proposing a project, designed in collaboration with the partner agency, to produce during the remaining eight months of the residency.  The Implementation Phase of the residency is marked by approval of the project proposal and initiation of the work.  The proposed project must be collaborative in nature and include at least one (1) public-facing event or component. Both DCLA and the partner agency will continue to provide the artist support during the project\u2019s production for the duration of the residency.  <br/><br/>Throughout the residency, the artist and agencies have weekly check-ins by phone or in-person to assist in project production.<br/><br/>PAIR funding per residency is $40,000: $20,000 for the Research Phase and $20,000 for the Implementation Phase.

It sits between St. Louis\u2019 Central West End and Forest Park Southeast neighborhoods and is surrounded by nationally ranked universities and medical centers, cultural assets, historic neighborhoods, and public spaces, including the Grand Center Arts District, Forest Park, and the Grove. The complete Cortex development plan includes support for $2.3 billion of development: 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use buildings (research, office, clinical, residential, hotel, and retail), as well as a MetroLink light-rail station, a publicly-accessible park, and 15,000 permanent technology-related jobs for the St. Louis region. Currently, over 390 companies call the Cortex Innovation Community home. The Community is an open place for big thinkers and risk takers, home to tech startups, manufacturers, corporate research and development teams, nonprofit organizations, and local restaurants, as well as entrepreneurs, artists, designers, side-hustlers, researchers, chefs, and students -- anyone who wants to build a product, grow a business, throw a party, or make connections.<br/><br/>ABOUT CORTEX<br/>Cortex is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that oversees development of the Cortex Innovation Community, founded by Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University, University of Missouri - St. Louis, BJC Healthcare, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. Cortex staff and leadership are committed to creating a community in which everyone has access to office space, capital investment, business education, mentoring, and community events. We are building a dynamic, 24/7 neighborhood of restaurants, nightlife, shops green spaces, and apartments. Cortex is committed to fostering an innovation community in which the benefits of new company formation, capital investment, job creation and wealth generation extend to all. We work closely with our District innovation centers, founding partners, and other entrepreneur support organizations across the region to create and strengthen that community. We recognize that we are part of a larger movement for inclusive economic transformation of the St. Louis region. <br/><br/>ART PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br/>The Cortex Parking Garage is currently under construction. It is located in the center of the Cortex Innovation Community to the east of the 4220 Duncan building. The south fa\u00e7ade of the garage will face the future Chouteau Greenway urban trail and a recently opened MetroLink light rail station. <br/><br/>Phase 1 of the garage will have five levels made up of three bays that together are 179 feet long. The construction of Phase 1 is scheduled to be completed in May 2019. A future expansion of the garage to the east would add another two to three bays and five to six levels. While the artwork installation for Phase 2 of the garage will not occur within the current timeline, finalists will create a design for both portions of the structure, as explained below. <br/><br/>The new artwork on the south fa\u00e7ade of the parking garage will be viewed by those entering and exiting the garage and will be highly visible to both MetroLink riders and passersby on the Chouteau Greenway. The artwork will also be visible to pedestrians and drivers from many other vantage points throughout the area and from nearby structures. <br/><br/>The artwork should make use of the design of the structure in creating a site-specific piece. Proposals are not requested at this time, but finalists selected to develop a proposal will need to work within the technical constraints of the garage design, phased construction schedule and consideration of additional areas of the garage in their design. Detailed information will be shared with finalists to include the following considerations:<br/>\u2022\tCompleted artwork should be permanent or semi-permanent with a minimum longevity of ten years. <br/>\u2022\tMinimal additional weight can be added to the structure of the garage and the artwork must not hinder air flow through garage openings. A painted mural, graphic treatment, or lightweight attachments to the garage face would be possible. Electricity can be made available. Finalists will be free to explore creative solutions in their concept proposals within the technical constraints. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists\u2019 concept proposals will address both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the garage construction. Because the Phase 1 artwork will be completed before the construction of Phase 2, the first phase of artwork must be both independent and complementary with the design of Phase 2.<br/>\u2022\tFinalists have the option to include the south stair concrete element in the scope of their design. The selected artist will also be consulted in selecting a complimentary color treatment for the west fa\u00e7ade and northwest stair concrete element and elevator shaft.<br/><br/>ART PROJECT GOALS<br/>The project should achieve the following goals:<br/>\u2022\tBuild on the image of Cortex as a premier national and international innovation hub.<br/>\u2022\tReflect the spirit of the cutting edge, vibrant and energetic Cortex community. <br/>\u2022\tServe as a gateway and point of arrival into Cortex.<br/>\u2022\tCreate an iconic point of interest to bring attention to Cortex and help spread Cortex\u2019s message.<br/>\u2022\tUse a functional parking infrastructure in a creative, innovative way. <br/>\u2022\tHighlight the interplay of movement seen from the MetroLink and the Chouteau Greenway to emphasize energy and activity.<br/>\u2022\tAs one of the first major public art commissions in Cortex, set a high bar that energizes the community to use public art in future developments and public spaces.   <br/><br/>ARTIST SELECTION PROCESS<br/>\u2022\tArtist submissions will be reviewed by an Artist Selection Panel (ASP), made up of regional curators, arts leadership and design professionals from the St. Louis community, as well as Cortex stakeholders. <br/>\u2022\tThe ASP will select up to three (3) finalists to develop and present concept proposals. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists will receive a stipend of $5000 to participate in the concept proposal process, which will include touring Cortex and meeting community members prior to developing a proposal, and to present their proposal. Proposals will include renderings and a short narrative description addressing both Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as a preliminary budget and timeline for completing Phase 1. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists will return to St. Louis to present their concept proposals directly to the ASP in person and to present their design at a Venture Caf\u00e9 Gathering, which is open to the public. Feedback from attendees of this presentation will be shared with the ASP.  The ASP will recommend a final artist/design for the project. <br/>\u2022\tArtists living more than 100 miles from Cortex will be paid an additional amount up to $2000 for travel and lodging expenses in St. Louis for visits during the selection process, including the finalists\u2019 introduction to Cortex and the presentations of the concept proposal.<br/><br/>FINALIST SELECTION CRITERIA<br/>The following criteria will be used by the Artist Selection Panel to select up to three (3) finalists.<br/>\u2022\tArtistic excellence as demonstrated by past work and submitted materials.<br/>\u2022\tA clear understanding of the project.<br/>\u2022\tA body of work that demonstrates an ability to create an artwork that responds to the goals of the project.<br/>\u2022\tAvailability to meet the project timeline.<br/>\u2022\tExperience executing projects of similar scale and budget.

This limited understanding of freedom has led to the creation of a system that constrains the movement of the many to reinforce the supposed freedom of the few. Policies of containment can be found throughout the history of the United States: Japanese internment camps, Native American reservation systems, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Jim Crow segregation, not to mention today\u2019s mass incarceration of people of color, the travel ban blocking entry to those from majority-Muslim nations, and the shutdown of the government over the funding of a border wall between the United States and Mexico.  <br/>\u200b<br/>In our modern history of art, freedom has also been conceptualized as movement: the avant-garde push our society forward through their new and unconventional choices.  Like the first line of an army charging into battle, these artists attempt novel works of art while denying any previous influences or collaborators. This concept of freedom has restricted our understanding of what artistic genius looks like to the domain of white men, who, as art historian Linda Nochlin famously pointed out, have suffered from less societal restrictions to their claims of independence and exceptionality. <br/> <br/>Contemporary artists and historians working in disability studies, gender studies, critical race theory, and queer theory, among other fields, have begun the important work of dismantling the conflation of freedom with movement.  How does our current limited definition of freedom support hegemonic capitalist, nationalist, sexist, racist, ablest, homophobic, transphobic systems of power in the art world and beyond? How can we visualize alternative notions of freedom through art? How can mobility participate in the limitation or denial of such freedoms? And what happens when artists and viewers not only resist moving forward, but choose to stand shockingly still? <br/> <br/>The group exhibition, Art Stands Still, will open at Collar Works, a repurposed textile factory, within Troy, New York, a city that was once celebrated for its position at the forefront of American industrial achievement. Like many Rust Belt economies, it experienced a sharp economic decline in the late twentieth century. What is forward for cities like Troy?

Yet it can also remind us of cities and the manmade \u2013 green glass skyscrapers, copper rooftops, the Statue of Liberty, and printed money. Emotionally, green has long signified envy, a pit of snakes coiled in the body. But add white and the color turns minty, suggesting more pleasant and peaceful states of mind.  What does green mean to you? How does this elusive color make its way into your work, either as the star player or in a supporting role?

Economies of attention and dis-attention, click bait, cloud analytics, memes, social media and fake news have now taken center stage in the process of subjectivation and the interiorization of domination. Could the spreading wave of Populism worldwide be the result of forms of embodied and extended cognition linked to contemporary neoliberal apparatuses? The central thesis of this year\u2019s program posits that these are the initial constituents and first signs of an impending crisis that define a later stage of cognitive capitalism. New technologies on the horizon, such as brain computer interfaces, cortical implants and optogenetics, provide an imminent threat and could create the core technologies that instigate, track, measure, and record the brains\u2019 capacities to generate electrical signals (or brain waves) during wake and sleep which then might be linked to the Internet and virtual platforms. Companies funded by DARPA, like Neuralink and Kernel, are at the forefront of these efforts to produce \u201ctotal subsumption\u201d. On the other hand, perhaps these new technologies will make brain power obsolete as humans are replaced by AI and robots and are no longer necessary for military regimes or physical and mental labor. As such, the nightmare of science fiction and right-leaning accelerationism might become reality. <br/><br/>SFSIA 2019 asks what effect these transformations might have on human consciousness and its various social and cultural expressions and permutations as defined in the fields of neuroaesthetics, psychology, politics, philosophy of mind, queer and gender studies, popular and visual culture, cultural and decolonial studies, art history, visual and sound art, film studies, as well as, sociology and economics. How might we together understand these changes in the context of artistic research programs that (already) use the lenses of post-humanism, transhumanism, and speculative materialism?
