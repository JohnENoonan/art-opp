The key objectives are to create a lasting tribute to Rosalie Gardiner Jones that is integrated with the Cold Spring Harbor State Park site and utilizes materials that are durable and require minimal maintenance and care.<br/><br/>Jones was an outspoken advocate for woman\u2019s suffrage, most often on the grass roots level. She not only<br/>travelled across Long Island with her yellow \u201cSuffrage Wagon,\u201d she also campaigned for women\u2019s suffrage<br/>in New York City, Washington, DC, and across the country. Most famously, she led a \u201chike\u201d from the Bronx<br/>to Albany in December 1912 to present a petition to the newly elected governor urging that women be given<br/>the right to vote. Two months later, \u201cGeneral\u201d Jones led her \u201cArmy of the Hudson\u201d on another march or<br/>\u201cpilgrimage\u201d from Newark, New Jersey, to Washington, DC, to participate in the famous suffrage parade on<br/>the eve of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration. Jones and her followers wore long brown pilgrim capes for this<br/>march and their second hike up the west side of the Hudson to Albany in 1914. These marches gained extensive publicity for the suffrage cause in newspapers throughout the country and resulted in General<br/>Jones becoming a national celebrity. She spoke for suffrage in Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, and<br/>New Jersey. Jones also led parades on Long Island, flew over Staten Island in a bi-plane dropping suffrage<br/>leaflets, and campaigned throughout New York State in a yellow suffrage automobile, spreading the gospel<br/>of Votes for Women. Jones was born in New York City, but spent much of her life in the family mansion on<br/>the west side of Cold Spring Harbor, opposite what is now Cold Spring Harbor State Park.<br/><br/>The monument to memorialize \u201cGeneral\u201d Jones should engage the public. It should communicate the<br/>strength and courage exhibited by Jones as she endeavored to make women\u2019s suffrage a reality through its<br/>materiality, its form and its setting.

Throughout the canon of art history, the human figure has been a central theme, as we grapple with our own existence, feeding a desire to self represent and to understand our place in the universe. This exhibition will present works by contemporary artists who address the figure not just as an object of beauty, or a subject of anatomy, but rather elaborate on contemporary themes of body positive depictions of the human form, including all body types, ages and genders, celebrating diversity as well as the timeless beauty of the body.<br/><br/>What is Body Positivity? The body-positive movement, which dates back to early Victorian reforms against the corset, 1960\u2019s initiatives against fat-shaming, and more recently via social media with influencers challenging unrealistic standards of beauty, is \u201crooted in the belief that all human beings should have a positive body image, while challenging the ways in which society presents and views the physical body. The goal of the movement is to address unrealistic beauty standards and to build the confidence of oneself and others. The movement sets forth the notion that beauty is a construct of society, and poses that this construct should not infringe upon one's ability to feel confidence or self-worth. The movement states that neither fat-shaming nor skinny-shaming is acceptable, and that all body types can and should be celebrated.\u201d<br/><br/>The \u201cBody Beautiful\u201d exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works will be considered in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, and performance amongst others. <br/><br/>The group show will take place at The Untitled Space gallery in Tribeca, New York, as well as online on Artsy. The exhibit is open to submissions until September 30, 2019.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE<br/>The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street. Founded in 2015 by Indira Cesarine, the gallery features an ongoing curation of exhibits of emerging and established contemporary artists exploring conceptual framework and boundary-pushing ideology through mediums of painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, video and performance art. The gallery is committing to exploring new ideas vis-\u00e0-vis traditional and new mediums and highlights a program of women in art as well as special events aligned with our creative vision.<br/><br/>ABOUT CURATOR INDIRA CESARINE<br/>Indira Cesarine\u2019s curatorial for The Untitled Space gallery includes includes solo shows for artists Sarah Maple, Rebecca Leveille, Alison Jackson, Fahren Feingold, Kat Toronto aka Miss Meatface, and Jeanette Hayes as well as group shows \u201cIRL: Investigating Reality\u201d, \"EDEN\" and \"(HOTEL) XX\" at SPRING/BREAK Art Show; \u201dSECRET GARDEN\u201d presenting the female gaze on erotica; \u201cSHE INSPIRES,\u201d a group show of 60 artists exhibiting works honoring inspirational women; internationally-celebrated group shows \u201cUPRISE/ANGRY WOMEN,\u201d and \u201cONE YEAR OF RESISTANCE\u201d responding to the political climate in America, as well as numerous other critically-acclaimed exhibitions.

FringeArts received a New Audiences New Places grant from the William Penn Foundation in the spring of 2018. This grant, titled Fringe Populi: Building Audiences through Public Performance, seeks to \u201cbuild new audiences through large-scale public practice works [that] generate both wide attention through scale, spectacle, and resonance of content,\u201d and that provide \u201cmore focused, deeper engagement with individuals recruited to participate in the work.\u201d<br/><br/>Previous examples of public practice pieces stewarded by FringeArts include Le Grand Continental (2012, Sylvain \u00c9mard), 100% Philadelphia (2014, Rimini Protokoll), Gala (2016, Jer\u00f4me Bel), Le Super Grand Continental (2018, Sylvain \u00c9mard), and \u00daumbal: Nomadic Choreography for Inhabitants (2019, Mariana Arteaga). The 2020 Fringe Populi piece will be the culminating performance in the Fringe Populi New Audiences New Places grant that aims to break down perception barriers which keep the Philadelphia public from engaging in contemporary performance.<br/><br/>The Artist\u2019s piece should aim to engage between 100-250 performers at varying levels of engagement and commitment. Artist proposals will provide a clear outline of project dramaturgy, recruitment, rehearsal structure, and performance. The priorities of the Fringe Populi project are to cultivate wide encounters of contemporary performance with the Philadelphia public, present work that is free and outdoors, and to engage with civically-activated spaces.<br/><br/>Proposal applications open on Monday, September 9th and are due back to FringeArts by 5:00pm on Monday, October 7th.
