To that end, DCLA embeds socially engaged artists in New York City municipal agencies in order to use creative, collaborative art practice to propose and implement creative solutions to pressing civic challenges.<br/><br/>Launched in 2015, PAIR takes its name and inspiration from the pioneering work of artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the first official artist in residence with the NYC Department of Sanitation (1977- present).  Since establishing the program, DCLA has embedded 10 artists in 8 agencies, including Tania Bruguera at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, The Lost Collective at the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh at the Commission on Human Rights, among others. For a full list of PAIRs to date, click here.  <br/><br/>All of the PAIR partnerships \u2013 some of which are still ongoing \u2013 vary greatly in concept, scope, duration, and populations engaged, and their successes are driven by the openness of the partner agencies and the artist-led, collaborative process that the PAIR program framework provides. <br/><br/>RESIDENCY STRUTURE, FEES, and MATERIALS<br/>PAIR residencies begin with a required half-day orientation session, which kicks off a three-month Research Phase.  This Phase is a time for the artist and agency to establish mutual trust through shared exposure to each other\u2019s work and process\u2014the artist shadows agency staff and attends meetings, trainings and site visits, and in turn the agency hosts an artist talk and visits the artist at their studio.  <br/><br/>The Research Phase ends with the artist proposing a project, designed in collaboration with the partner agency, to produce during the remaining eight months of the residency.  The Implementation Phase of the residency is marked by approval of the project proposal and initiation of the work.  The proposed project must be collaborative in nature and include at least one (1) public-facing event or component. Both DCLA and the partner agency will continue to provide the artist support during the project\u2019s production for the duration of the residency.  <br/><br/>Throughout the residency, the artist and agencies have weekly check-ins by phone or in-person to assist in project production.<br/><br/>PAIR funding per residency is $40,000: $20,000 for the Research Phase and $20,000 for the Implementation Phase.

It sits between St. Louis\u2019 Central West End and Forest Park Southeast neighborhoods and is surrounded by nationally ranked universities and medical centers, cultural assets, historic neighborhoods, and public spaces, including the Grand Center Arts District, Forest Park, and the Grove. The complete Cortex development plan includes support for $2.3 billion of development: 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use buildings (research, office, clinical, residential, hotel, and retail), as well as a MetroLink light-rail station, a publicly-accessible park, and 15,000 permanent technology-related jobs for the St. Louis region. Currently, over 390 companies call the Cortex Innovation Community home. The Community is an open place for big thinkers and risk takers, home to tech startups, manufacturers, corporate research and development teams, nonprofit organizations, and local restaurants, as well as entrepreneurs, artists, designers, side-hustlers, researchers, chefs, and students -- anyone who wants to build a product, grow a business, throw a party, or make connections.<br/><br/>ABOUT CORTEX<br/>Cortex is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that oversees development of the Cortex Innovation Community, founded by Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University, University of Missouri - St. Louis, BJC Healthcare, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. Cortex staff and leadership are committed to creating a community in which everyone has access to office space, capital investment, business education, mentoring, and community events. We are building a dynamic, 24/7 neighborhood of restaurants, nightlife, shops green spaces, and apartments. Cortex is committed to fostering an innovation community in which the benefits of new company formation, capital investment, job creation and wealth generation extend to all. We work closely with our District innovation centers, founding partners, and other entrepreneur support organizations across the region to create and strengthen that community. We recognize that we are part of a larger movement for inclusive economic transformation of the St. Louis region. <br/><br/>ART PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br/>The Cortex Parking Garage is currently under construction. It is located in the center of the Cortex Innovation Community to the east of the 4220 Duncan building. The south fa\u00e7ade of the garage will face the future Chouteau Greenway urban trail and a recently opened MetroLink light rail station. <br/><br/>Phase 1 of the garage will have five levels made up of three bays that together are 179 feet long. The construction of Phase 1 is scheduled to be completed in May 2019. A future expansion of the garage to the east would add another two to three bays and five to six levels. While the artwork installation for Phase 2 of the garage will not occur within the current timeline, finalists will create a design for both portions of the structure, as explained below. <br/><br/>The new artwork on the south fa\u00e7ade of the parking garage will be viewed by those entering and exiting the garage and will be highly visible to both MetroLink riders and passersby on the Chouteau Greenway. The artwork will also be visible to pedestrians and drivers from many other vantage points throughout the area and from nearby structures. <br/><br/>The artwork should make use of the design of the structure in creating a site-specific piece. Proposals are not requested at this time, but finalists selected to develop a proposal will need to work within the technical constraints of the garage design, phased construction schedule and consideration of additional areas of the garage in their design. Detailed information will be shared with finalists to include the following considerations:<br/>\u2022\tCompleted artwork should be permanent or semi-permanent with a minimum longevity of ten years. <br/>\u2022\tMinimal additional weight can be added to the structure of the garage and the artwork must not hinder air flow through garage openings. A painted mural, graphic treatment, or lightweight attachments to the garage face would be possible. Electricity can be made available. Finalists will be free to explore creative solutions in their concept proposals within the technical constraints. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists\u2019 concept proposals will address both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the garage construction. Because the Phase 1 artwork will be completed before the construction of Phase 2, the first phase of artwork must be both independent and complementary with the design of Phase 2.<br/>\u2022\tFinalists have the option to include the south stair concrete element in the scope of their design. The selected artist will also be consulted in selecting a complimentary color treatment for the west fa\u00e7ade and northwest stair concrete element and elevator shaft.<br/><br/>ART PROJECT GOALS<br/>The project should achieve the following goals:<br/>\u2022\tBuild on the image of Cortex as a premier national and international innovation hub.<br/>\u2022\tReflect the spirit of the cutting edge, vibrant and energetic Cortex community. <br/>\u2022\tServe as a gateway and point of arrival into Cortex.<br/>\u2022\tCreate an iconic point of interest to bring attention to Cortex and help spread Cortex\u2019s message.<br/>\u2022\tUse a functional parking infrastructure in a creative, innovative way. <br/>\u2022\tHighlight the interplay of movement seen from the MetroLink and the Chouteau Greenway to emphasize energy and activity.<br/>\u2022\tAs one of the first major public art commissions in Cortex, set a high bar that energizes the community to use public art in future developments and public spaces.   <br/><br/>ARTIST SELECTION PROCESS<br/>\u2022\tArtist submissions will be reviewed by an Artist Selection Panel (ASP), made up of regional curators, arts leadership and design professionals from the St. Louis community, as well as Cortex stakeholders. <br/>\u2022\tThe ASP will select up to three (3) finalists to develop and present concept proposals. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists will receive a stipend of $5000 to participate in the concept proposal process, which will include touring Cortex and meeting community members prior to developing a proposal, and to present their proposal. Proposals will include renderings and a short narrative description addressing both Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as a preliminary budget and timeline for completing Phase 1. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists will return to St. Louis to present their concept proposals directly to the ASP in person and to present their design at a Venture Caf\u00e9 Gathering, which is open to the public. Feedback from attendees of this presentation will be shared with the ASP.  The ASP will recommend a final artist/design for the project. <br/>\u2022\tArtists living more than 100 miles from Cortex will be paid an additional amount up to $2000 for travel and lodging expenses in St. Louis for visits during the selection process, including the finalists\u2019 introduction to Cortex and the presentations of the concept proposal.<br/><br/>FINALIST SELECTION CRITERIA<br/>The following criteria will be used by the Artist Selection Panel to select up to three (3) finalists.<br/>\u2022\tArtistic excellence as demonstrated by past work and submitted materials.<br/>\u2022\tA clear understanding of the project.<br/>\u2022\tA body of work that demonstrates an ability to create an artwork that responds to the goals of the project.<br/>\u2022\tAvailability to meet the project timeline.<br/>\u2022\tExperience executing projects of similar scale and budget.

This limited understanding of freedom has led to the creation of a system that constrains the movement of the many to reinforce the supposed freedom of the few. Policies of containment can be found throughout the history of the United States: Japanese internment camps, Native American reservation systems, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Jim Crow segregation, not to mention today\u2019s mass incarceration of people of color, the travel ban blocking entry to those from majority-Muslim nations, and the shutdown of the government over the funding of a border wall between the United States and Mexico.  <br/>\u200b<br/>In our modern history of art, freedom has also been conceptualized as movement: the avant-garde push our society forward through their new and unconventional choices.  Like the first line of an army charging into battle, these artists attempt novel works of art while denying any previous influences or collaborators. This concept of freedom has restricted our understanding of what artistic genius looks like to the domain of white men, who, as art historian Linda Nochlin famously pointed out, have suffered from less societal restrictions to their claims of independence and exceptionality. <br/> <br/>Contemporary artists and historians working in disability studies, gender studies, critical race theory, and queer theory, among other fields, have begun the important work of dismantling the conflation of freedom with movement.  How does our current limited definition of freedom support hegemonic capitalist, nationalist, sexist, racist, ablest, homophobic, transphobic systems of power in the art world and beyond? How can we visualize alternative notions of freedom through art? How can mobility participate in the limitation or denial of such freedoms? And what happens when artists and viewers not only resist moving forward, but choose to stand shockingly still? <br/> <br/>The group exhibition, Art Stands Still, will open at Collar Works, a repurposed textile factory, within Troy, New York, a city that was once celebrated for its position at the forefront of American industrial achievement. Like many Rust Belt economies, it experienced a sharp economic decline in the late twentieth century. What is forward for cities like Troy?

Yet it can also remind us of cities and the manmade \u2013 green glass skyscrapers, copper rooftops, the Statue of Liberty, and printed money. Emotionally, green has long signified envy, a pit of snakes coiled in the body. But add white and the color turns minty, suggesting more pleasant and peaceful states of mind.  What does green mean to you? How does this elusive color make its way into your work, either as the star player or in a supporting role?

Economies of attention and dis-attention, click bait, cloud analytics, memes, social media and fake news have now taken center stage in the process of subjectivation and the interiorization of domination. Could the spreading wave of Populism worldwide be the result of forms of embodied and extended cognition linked to contemporary neoliberal apparatuses? The central thesis of this year\u2019s program posits that these are the initial constituents and first signs of an impending crisis that define a later stage of cognitive capitalism. New technologies on the horizon, such as brain computer interfaces, cortical implants and optogenetics, provide an imminent threat and could create the core technologies that instigate, track, measure, and record the brains\u2019 capacities to generate electrical signals (or brain waves) during wake and sleep which then might be linked to the Internet and virtual platforms. Companies funded by DARPA, like Neuralink and Kernel, are at the forefront of these efforts to produce \u201ctotal subsumption\u201d. On the other hand, perhaps these new technologies will make brain power obsolete as humans are replaced by AI and robots and are no longer necessary for military regimes or physical and mental labor. As such, the nightmare of science fiction and right-leaning accelerationism might become reality. <br/><br/>SFSIA 2019 asks what effect these transformations might have on human consciousness and its various social and cultural expressions and permutations as defined in the fields of neuroaesthetics, psychology, politics, philosophy of mind, queer and gender studies, popular and visual culture, cultural and decolonial studies, art history, visual and sound art, film studies, as well as, sociology and economics. How might we together understand these changes in the context of artistic research programs that (already) use the lenses of post-humanism, transhumanism, and speculative materialism?

The exhibit is open to submissions until April 28, 2019.<br/><br/>The Definition of \u201cIrl\u201d:\u00a0Irl stands for \u201cin real life\u201d. \"Real life\" is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the real world and fictional or idealized worlds, and in acting to distinguish between performers and the characters they portray. The phrase \u201cirl\u201d emerged in the early days of the Internet when people saw a need to distinguish things that were happening online from things that were happening offline. As people found ways to present an alternate picture of themselves online, irl became a shorthand for distinguishing between how things appear online and how they are in reality. It can also be used to distinguish reality from something that happens in games, on social media, or on TV or in films.<br/><br/>The group exhibition, \u201cIRL: Investigating Reality,\u201d\u00a0curated by gallery director Indira Cesarine, will feature contemporary artists exploring what \u201cIRL\u201d means to them in today\u2019s digital world. Artwork for IRL should conceptualize what \u201cin real life\u201d means, and may present the mundanities of \u201creal life\u201d or explore the intersection of digital and physical worlds. Works may address concepts of \u201cauthenticity\u201d versus edited, retouched or fictitious realities with an emphasis on realism or \"reality\" as we know it. <br/><br/>The exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works can be in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, performance amongst others. All works must be created within the last 2 years, with a priority on new, previously unexhibited artworks. Art must be ready to hang or install. Artists may submit up to 5 works of art for consideration, which may include renderings or proposals of works to be created specifically for the exhibition.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE<br/>The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street.

To put down roots is a common American expression that directly relates the long-term growth and stability of plants to the same long-term development of human habitats. With a multitude of insinuations, it\u2019s a concept with that is being increasingly challenged in our current sociopolitical global economy. We chose this theme to bring awareness to these faults and consider ways artists dissect this broad but impressionable word. <br/><br/>Acceptable Artwork:<br/>Painting, photography, prints, works on paper, 3D sculpture, fiber arts, sound, and video. All works on paper (including photography) MUST be in a non-ornamental frame - either white, black, or light wood -  unless explicit reasoning as to otherwise can be presented. Explanation can only relate to the content or aesthetic of the work. Artwork must be no larger than 35\u201d in any direction, no longer than 2 min in length, and weigh no more than 20 lbs.<br/><br/>About PARADICE PALASE:<br/>We are a project space in Brooklyn, NY that confronts the limitations of the art world by creating a self sustaining, community-minded and inclusive space. We are dedicated to furthering the development of artists and building a symbiotic network of patrons and creators. We create accessibility in the arts by offering affordable artwork, monthly programs, and membership benefits to our community. <br/><br/>About the Guest Juror:<br/>Tiffany Smith is an interdisciplinary artist from the Caribbean diaspora, working in photography, video, installation, and design. Using plant matter, design and home decor elements, pattern, and costuming as cultural signifiers, Smith creates photographic portraits, site responsive installations, user engaged experiences, and assemblages focused on identity, representation, cultural ambiguity, and displacement. Visual references from an array of multi-cultural influences, derived from her upbringing between Miami, Florida, Nassau, Bahamas, and Jamaica inform constructed environments that serve to articulate cultural subjectivities that oscillate between visitor and native roles. Smith\u2019s practice centers on what forms and defines communities of people color, in particular; how they are identified and represented, and how they endure. She is a recipient of the 2018 NYFA Fellowship Award and the Bronx En Foco photography award. She has collaborated with non-profit organizations such as Recess Art and is a faculty member teaching photography at SVA. <br/><br/>Eligibility:<br/>Artists 18 years and older living and working within the United States who do not have gallery representation are welcome to apply.

In simpler terms, light gives life; under certain circumstances light also facilitates destruction. Capturing light in visual terms has always been a crucial element in traditional painting. With multi-media, installation, and conceptual-based artwork, light takes on an equally important role for the artist.   <br/><br/>Jurors for the \u201cLight\u201d show are Lauren Hirshfield and Kat Ryals, <br/>Co-Directors of Paradice Palase in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE JURORS:<br/><br/>Lauren Hirshfield is an independent curator and artist living and working in NYC. She received a BFA in painting, arts management and art history from SUNY Purchase. Over the past five years she has freelanced as an arts administrator, assistant, and curator for organizations such as Superchief Gallery, 4Heads/Portal, POWRPLNT and ArtMoney. Her curatorial practice is fueled by the ephemeral, the ethereal and the tactile. She is interested in further democratizing the art world and strives to consider accessible ways the public can engage with art.<br/><br/>Kat Ryals is an artist, curator and photographer based in Brooklyn, NY. She received a BFA in photography in 2010 from Savannah College of Art and Design, and an MFA in Visual Art and Museum Education from Brooklyn College.

Children, who are more in touch with their senses, are attuned to what nature has to teach them.  Let's follow them: they are harbingers. Yoga, meditation, rites of passage... They use all that is available to them in seeking the right rhythm, in cultivating the kind of benevolence that gives meaning to one\u2019s presence in the world.  This takes the form of a daily commitment, of maieutic engagement. In the wake of Timoci Naulusala or Greta Thunberg and other budding activists, they are brimming with good ideas to change our modes of life: they plant trees, cultivate vegetable gardens in cities, recycle garbage, make objects from recycled materials, organize pottery classes to reconnect with the earth and with others. In doing so, they also undergo a metamorphosis and set out to meet their true selves.<br/><br/>Key words: Sustainability and circular economy activism, common sense, poetic workwear<br/>Key pieces: Simple, practical garments with refined details, overalls, cotton seersucker smocks, knit rompers<br/>Fabrics: bamboo viscose, natural materials, washed linens, open stitch mesh, handmade knitwear<br/>Prints: wildflowers, dry vegetation, fruits from the orchard, positive symbols, talismans<br/>Colors: Warm, earthy and vegetable, half-shades, lighted by a buttercup yellow<br/><br/>#2 FANTASIA <br/><br/>Why not reach out for that hand and join the dance!<br/>You find yourself in a teeming phantasmagoria peopled with strange, half animal, half human creatures... A poetic and joyful fantasy where all wear masks, where optical illusions reign. In a setting somewhere between inextricable jungle and imaginary architectures, one camouflages or presents oneself with panache. Behind every door, a surprise! All possibles are open: one can don any costume, live in different skins, and reinvent oneself to the whim of nested identities. Therein resides the whole magic of childhood... But is it a dream or simply the carnival of life that marches in front of your astonished eyes?<br/><br/>Key words: fantasy, graphic and playful cuts, optical illusions, hidden details, color blocks, gathers, ruches, giant flounces<br/>Key pieces: tulle overdresses, tops and dresses with oversized sleeves, smocked shorts<br/>Fabrics: fluid jerseys, supple satins, tulle, textured knits<br/>Prints: extraordinary worlds, fairytales and legends, terrestrial and aquatic animals, strange plants, surreal collages, free forms, neo camo<br/>Colors: extraordinary multicolor plumages and bursts of exotic flowers, a kaki beauty treatment and deep jungle off-black<br/><br/><br/>PRESS START<br/><br/>Accustomed to instant communication and to open source information, the new urban generation seems to live accelerated lives. These 3.0 kids oscillate between reality and virtuality, between the physical and digital realms, mixing them with humor and great agility. Without judgment or self-consciousness they make an instinctive synthesis of them, guided by whatever gives them emotions. Movement: it is their watchword. In this unprecedented adventure, they unpack both future and heritage with the same appetite and appropriate both with spontaneity.

Smack Mellon is currently accepting applications from Emerging Artists to be considered for this exhibition.<br/><br/>Self-identifying women, in particular, are often overlooked as figures to be emulated, exempt from the label of \u201cgenius\u201d so readily bestowed upon men. Partially inspired by John Waters\u2019s Role Models, a pseudo-autobiography through his influences or \u201cfilth elders,\u201d the exhibition will emphasize work that presents women and women-identifying role models as sources of possibility, creativity, courage, self-fashioning and sometimes, transgression. While teens\u2019 fanatical impulse to paper their bedroom walls with imagery of their favorite stars is seen as merely an adolescent phase, Idol Worship asserts how the identification with role models is especially significant for those alienated from dominant social institutions, whether the biological family, history, or mainstream culture.<br/><br/>Idol Worship will be organized by guest curator Emily Colucci, whose proposal was selected through the Curatorial Proposal open call. To help elevate the profile of and bring greater exposure to emerging artists, this exhibition will include a combination of emerging artists chosen from an open call, as well as selected established artists. This open call is only for emerging artists, and at least half of the artists in the exhibition will be selected from this pool of applicants. An emerging artist is considered to be an artist without commercial representation who has a dedicated art practice but few opportunities to show at gallery or non-profit spaces. Submissions will be reviewed by the guest curator and Smack Mellon staff.<br/><br/>Artists whose practice includes paying tribute to, obsessing over, embodying, or otherwise complex engagements with women and women-identifying role models, heroes, idols, or filth elders, whether famous public figures, underground cult superstars, lesser known private muses, problematic faves, or unlikely sources of inspiration, are encouraged to apply. Transdisciplinary artists and cultural producers exploring the potential of role model worship as a source of sustainment are also of interest.<br/><br/>The exhibition will run from November 16 through December 29, 2019 (opening date to be confirmed).<br/><br/>Emily Colucci is a writer, curator and co-founder of Filthy Dreams, an award-winning blog analyzing art, culture and politics through a queer lens and a touch of camp. In 2016, she was awarded the Creative Capital | Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant for Filthy Dreams. In addition, Colucci has contributed to exhibition catalogues, most recently for Devan Shimoyama\u2019s Cry, Baby at the Andy Warhol Museum, artist books, and online and print magazines, such as Conde Nast\u2019s them., VICE, Salon, LA Review of Books and more. She has previously curated Night Fever at Pittsburgh\u2019s Future Tenant, and co-curated Party Out Of Bounds: Nightlife As Activism Since 1980 at New York\u2019s La MaMa Galleria with Visual AIDS, as well as its satellite installation Courtship Disorder by John Walter in London\u2019s White Cubicle Toilet Gallery at the late George & Dragon Pub.", "Application Instructions": "Submit your application using Smack Mellon\u2019s online application portal on Submittable: <a href=\"https://smackmellon.submittable.com/submit.\" target=\"_blank\">https://smackmellon.submittable.com</a> We welcome submissions of existing works and proposals for new projects.
