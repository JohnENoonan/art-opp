To that end, DCLA embeds socially engaged artists in New York City municipal agencies in order to use creative, collaborative art practice to propose and implement creative solutions to pressing civic challenges.<br/><br/>Launched in 2015, PAIR takes its name and inspiration from the pioneering work of artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the first official artist in residence with the NYC Department of Sanitation (1977- present).  Since establishing the program, DCLA has embedded 10 artists in 8 agencies, including Tania Bruguera at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, The Lost Collective at the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh at the Commission on Human Rights, among others. For a full list of PAIRs to date, click here.  <br/><br/>All of the PAIR partnerships \u2013 some of which are still ongoing \u2013 vary greatly in concept, scope, duration, and populations engaged, and their successes are driven by the openness of the partner agencies and the artist-led, collaborative process that the PAIR program framework provides. <br/><br/>RESIDENCY STRUTURE, FEES, and MATERIALS<br/>PAIR residencies begin with a required half-day orientation session, which kicks off a three-month Research Phase.  This Phase is a time for the artist and agency to establish mutual trust through shared exposure to each other\u2019s work and process\u2014the artist shadows agency staff and attends meetings, trainings and site visits, and in turn the agency hosts an artist talk and visits the artist at their studio.  <br/><br/>The Research Phase ends with the artist proposing a project, designed in collaboration with the partner agency, to produce during the remaining eight months of the residency.  The Implementation Phase of the residency is marked by approval of the project proposal and initiation of the work.  The proposed project must be collaborative in nature and include at least one (1) public-facing event or component. Both DCLA and the partner agency will continue to provide the artist support during the project\u2019s production for the duration of the residency.  <br/><br/>Throughout the residency, the artist and agencies have weekly check-ins by phone or in-person to assist in project production.<br/><br/>PAIR funding per residency is $40,000: $20,000 for the Research Phase and $20,000 for the Implementation Phase.

It sits between St. Louis\u2019 Central West End and Forest Park Southeast neighborhoods and is surrounded by nationally ranked universities and medical centers, cultural assets, historic neighborhoods, and public spaces, including the Grand Center Arts District, Forest Park, and the Grove. The complete Cortex development plan includes support for $2.3 billion of development: 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use buildings (research, office, clinical, residential, hotel, and retail), as well as a MetroLink light-rail station, a publicly-accessible park, and 15,000 permanent technology-related jobs for the St. Louis region. Currently, over 390 companies call the Cortex Innovation Community home. The Community is an open place for big thinkers and risk takers, home to tech startups, manufacturers, corporate research and development teams, nonprofit organizations, and local restaurants, as well as entrepreneurs, artists, designers, side-hustlers, researchers, chefs, and students -- anyone who wants to build a product, grow a business, throw a party, or make connections.<br/><br/>ABOUT CORTEX<br/>Cortex is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that oversees development of the Cortex Innovation Community, founded by Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University, University of Missouri - St. Louis, BJC Healthcare, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. Cortex staff and leadership are committed to creating a community in which everyone has access to office space, capital investment, business education, mentoring, and community events. We are building a dynamic, 24/7 neighborhood of restaurants, nightlife, shops green spaces, and apartments. Cortex is committed to fostering an innovation community in which the benefits of new company formation, capital investment, job creation and wealth generation extend to all. We work closely with our District innovation centers, founding partners, and other entrepreneur support organizations across the region to create and strengthen that community. We recognize that we are part of a larger movement for inclusive economic transformation of the St. Louis region. <br/><br/>ART PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br/>The Cortex Parking Garage is currently under construction. It is located in the center of the Cortex Innovation Community to the east of the 4220 Duncan building. The south fa\u00e7ade of the garage will face the future Chouteau Greenway urban trail and a recently opened MetroLink light rail station. <br/><br/>Phase 1 of the garage will have five levels made up of three bays that together are 179 feet long. The construction of Phase 1 is scheduled to be completed in May 2019. A future expansion of the garage to the east would add another two to three bays and five to six levels. While the artwork installation for Phase 2 of the garage will not occur within the current timeline, finalists will create a design for both portions of the structure, as explained below. <br/><br/>The new artwork on the south fa\u00e7ade of the parking garage will be viewed by those entering and exiting the garage and will be highly visible to both MetroLink riders and passersby on the Chouteau Greenway. The artwork will also be visible to pedestrians and drivers from many other vantage points throughout the area and from nearby structures. <br/><br/>The artwork should make use of the design of the structure in creating a site-specific piece. Proposals are not requested at this time, but finalists selected to develop a proposal will need to work within the technical constraints of the garage design, phased construction schedule and consideration of additional areas of the garage in their design. Detailed information will be shared with finalists to include the following considerations:<br/>\u2022\tCompleted artwork should be permanent or semi-permanent with a minimum longevity of ten years. <br/>\u2022\tMinimal additional weight can be added to the structure of the garage and the artwork must not hinder air flow through garage openings. A painted mural, graphic treatment, or lightweight attachments to the garage face would be possible. Electricity can be made available. Finalists will be free to explore creative solutions in their concept proposals within the technical constraints. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists\u2019 concept proposals will address both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the garage construction. Because the Phase 1 artwork will be completed before the construction of Phase 2, the first phase of artwork must be both independent and complementary with the design of Phase 2.<br/>\u2022\tFinalists have the option to include the south stair concrete element in the scope of their design. The selected artist will also be consulted in selecting a complimentary color treatment for the west fa\u00e7ade and northwest stair concrete element and elevator shaft.<br/><br/>ART PROJECT GOALS<br/>The project should achieve the following goals:<br/>\u2022\tBuild on the image of Cortex as a premier national and international innovation hub.<br/>\u2022\tReflect the spirit of the cutting edge, vibrant and energetic Cortex community. <br/>\u2022\tServe as a gateway and point of arrival into Cortex.<br/>\u2022\tCreate an iconic point of interest to bring attention to Cortex and help spread Cortex\u2019s message.<br/>\u2022\tUse a functional parking infrastructure in a creative, innovative way. <br/>\u2022\tHighlight the interplay of movement seen from the MetroLink and the Chouteau Greenway to emphasize energy and activity.<br/>\u2022\tAs one of the first major public art commissions in Cortex, set a high bar that energizes the community to use public art in future developments and public spaces.   <br/><br/>ARTIST SELECTION PROCESS<br/>\u2022\tArtist submissions will be reviewed by an Artist Selection Panel (ASP), made up of regional curators, arts leadership and design professionals from the St. Louis community, as well as Cortex stakeholders. <br/>\u2022\tThe ASP will select up to three (3) finalists to develop and present concept proposals. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists will receive a stipend of $5000 to participate in the concept proposal process, which will include touring Cortex and meeting community members prior to developing a proposal, and to present their proposal. Proposals will include renderings and a short narrative description addressing both Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as a preliminary budget and timeline for completing Phase 1. <br/>\u2022\tFinalists will return to St. Louis to present their concept proposals directly to the ASP in person and to present their design at a Venture Caf\u00e9 Gathering, which is open to the public. Feedback from attendees of this presentation will be shared with the ASP.  The ASP will recommend a final artist/design for the project. <br/>\u2022\tArtists living more than 100 miles from Cortex will be paid an additional amount up to $2000 for travel and lodging expenses in St. Louis for visits during the selection process, including the finalists\u2019 introduction to Cortex and the presentations of the concept proposal.<br/><br/>FINALIST SELECTION CRITERIA<br/>The following criteria will be used by the Artist Selection Panel to select up to three (3) finalists.<br/>\u2022\tArtistic excellence as demonstrated by past work and submitted materials.<br/>\u2022\tA clear understanding of the project.<br/>\u2022\tA body of work that demonstrates an ability to create an artwork that responds to the goals of the project.<br/>\u2022\tAvailability to meet the project timeline.<br/>\u2022\tExperience executing projects of similar scale and budget.

This limited understanding of freedom has led to the creation of a system that constrains the movement of the many to reinforce the supposed freedom of the few. Policies of containment can be found throughout the history of the United States: Japanese internment camps, Native American reservation systems, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Jim Crow segregation, not to mention today\u2019s mass incarceration of people of color, the travel ban blocking entry to those from majority-Muslim nations, and the shutdown of the government over the funding of a border wall between the United States and Mexico.  <br/>\u200b<br/>In our modern history of art, freedom has also been conceptualized as movement: the avant-garde push our society forward through their new and unconventional choices.  Like the first line of an army charging into battle, these artists attempt novel works of art while denying any previous influences or collaborators. This concept of freedom has restricted our understanding of what artistic genius looks like to the domain of white men, who, as art historian Linda Nochlin famously pointed out, have suffered from less societal restrictions to their claims of independence and exceptionality. <br/> <br/>Contemporary artists and historians working in disability studies, gender studies, critical race theory, and queer theory, among other fields, have begun the important work of dismantling the conflation of freedom with movement.  How does our current limited definition of freedom support hegemonic capitalist, nationalist, sexist, racist, ablest, homophobic, transphobic systems of power in the art world and beyond? How can we visualize alternative notions of freedom through art? How can mobility participate in the limitation or denial of such freedoms? And what happens when artists and viewers not only resist moving forward, but choose to stand shockingly still? <br/> <br/>The group exhibition, Art Stands Still, will open at Collar Works, a repurposed textile factory, within Troy, New York, a city that was once celebrated for its position at the forefront of American industrial achievement. Like many Rust Belt economies, it experienced a sharp economic decline in the late twentieth century. What is forward for cities like Troy?

Yet it can also remind us of cities and the manmade \u2013 green glass skyscrapers, copper rooftops, the Statue of Liberty, and printed money. Emotionally, green has long signified envy, a pit of snakes coiled in the body. But add white and the color turns minty, suggesting more pleasant and peaceful states of mind.  What does green mean to you? How does this elusive color make its way into your work, either as the star player or in a supporting role?

Economies of attention and dis-attention, click bait, cloud analytics, memes, social media and fake news have now taken center stage in the process of subjectivation and the interiorization of domination. Could the spreading wave of Populism worldwide be the result of forms of embodied and extended cognition linked to contemporary neoliberal apparatuses? The central thesis of this year\u2019s program posits that these are the initial constituents and first signs of an impending crisis that define a later stage of cognitive capitalism. New technologies on the horizon, such as brain computer interfaces, cortical implants and optogenetics, provide an imminent threat and could create the core technologies that instigate, track, measure, and record the brains\u2019 capacities to generate electrical signals (or brain waves) during wake and sleep which then might be linked to the Internet and virtual platforms. Companies funded by DARPA, like Neuralink and Kernel, are at the forefront of these efforts to produce \u201ctotal subsumption\u201d. On the other hand, perhaps these new technologies will make brain power obsolete as humans are replaced by AI and robots and are no longer necessary for military regimes or physical and mental labor. As such, the nightmare of science fiction and right-leaning accelerationism might become reality. <br/><br/>SFSIA 2019 asks what effect these transformations might have on human consciousness and its various social and cultural expressions and permutations as defined in the fields of neuroaesthetics, psychology, politics, philosophy of mind, queer and gender studies, popular and visual culture, cultural and decolonial studies, art history, visual and sound art, film studies, as well as, sociology and economics. How might we together understand these changes in the context of artistic research programs that (already) use the lenses of post-humanism, transhumanism, and speculative materialism?

The exhibit is open to submissions until April 28, 2019.<br/><br/>The Definition of \u201cIrl\u201d:\u00a0Irl stands for \u201cin real life\u201d. \"Real life\" is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the real world and fictional or idealized worlds, and in acting to distinguish between performers and the characters they portray. The phrase \u201cirl\u201d emerged in the early days of the Internet when people saw a need to distinguish things that were happening online from things that were happening offline. As people found ways to present an alternate picture of themselves online, irl became a shorthand for distinguishing between how things appear online and how they are in reality. It can also be used to distinguish reality from something that happens in games, on social media, or on TV or in films.<br/><br/>The group exhibition, \u201cIRL: Investigating Reality,\u201d\u00a0curated by gallery director Indira Cesarine, will feature contemporary artists exploring what \u201cIRL\u201d means to them in today\u2019s digital world. Artwork for IRL should conceptualize what \u201cin real life\u201d means, and may present the mundanities of \u201creal life\u201d or explore the intersection of digital and physical worlds. Works may address concepts of \u201cauthenticity\u201d versus edited, retouched or fictitious realities with an emphasis on realism or \"reality\" as we know it. <br/><br/>The exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works can be in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, performance amongst others. All works must be created within the last 2 years, with a priority on new, previously unexhibited artworks. Art must be ready to hang or install. Artists may submit up to 5 works of art for consideration, which may include renderings or proposals of works to be created specifically for the exhibition.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE<br/>The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street.

To put down roots is a common American expression that directly relates the long-term growth and stability of plants to the same long-term development of human habitats. With a multitude of insinuations, it\u2019s a concept with that is being increasingly challenged in our current sociopolitical global economy. We chose this theme to bring awareness to these faults and consider ways artists dissect this broad but impressionable word. <br/><br/>Acceptable Artwork:<br/>Painting, photography, prints, works on paper, 3D sculpture, fiber arts, sound, and video. All works on paper (including photography) MUST be in a non-ornamental frame - either white, black, or light wood -  unless explicit reasoning as to otherwise can be presented. Explanation can only relate to the content or aesthetic of the work. Artwork must be no larger than 35\u201d in any direction, no longer than 2 min in length, and weigh no more than 20 lbs.<br/><br/>About PARADICE PALASE:<br/>We are a project space in Brooklyn, NY that confronts the limitations of the art world by creating a self sustaining, community-minded and inclusive space. We are dedicated to furthering the development of artists and building a symbiotic network of patrons and creators. We create accessibility in the arts by offering affordable artwork, monthly programs, and membership benefits to our community. <br/><br/>About the Guest Juror:<br/>Tiffany Smith is an interdisciplinary artist from the Caribbean diaspora, working in photography, video, installation, and design. Using plant matter, design and home decor elements, pattern, and costuming as cultural signifiers, Smith creates photographic portraits, site responsive installations, user engaged experiences, and assemblages focused on identity, representation, cultural ambiguity, and displacement. Visual references from an array of multi-cultural influences, derived from her upbringing between Miami, Florida, Nassau, Bahamas, and Jamaica inform constructed environments that serve to articulate cultural subjectivities that oscillate between visitor and native roles. Smith\u2019s practice centers on what forms and defines communities of people color, in particular; how they are identified and represented, and how they endure. She is a recipient of the 2018 NYFA Fellowship Award and the Bronx En Foco photography award. She has collaborated with non-profit organizations such as Recess Art and is a faculty member teaching photography at SVA. <br/><br/>Eligibility:<br/>Artists 18 years and older living and working within the United States who do not have gallery representation are welcome to apply.

In simpler terms, light gives life; under certain circumstances light also facilitates destruction. Capturing light in visual terms has always been a crucial element in traditional painting. With multi-media, installation, and conceptual-based artwork, light takes on an equally important role for the artist.   <br/><br/>Jurors for the \u201cLight\u201d show are Lauren Hirshfield and Kat Ryals, <br/>Co-Directors of Paradice Palase in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE JURORS:<br/><br/>Lauren Hirshfield is an independent curator and artist living and working in NYC. She received a BFA in painting, arts management and art history from SUNY Purchase. Over the past five years she has freelanced as an arts administrator, assistant, and curator for organizations such as Superchief Gallery, 4Heads/Portal, POWRPLNT and ArtMoney. Her curatorial practice is fueled by the ephemeral, the ethereal and the tactile. She is interested in further democratizing the art world and strives to consider accessible ways the public can engage with art.<br/><br/>Kat Ryals is an artist, curator and photographer based in Brooklyn, NY. She received a BFA in photography in 2010 from Savannah College of Art and Design, and an MFA in Visual Art and Museum Education from Brooklyn College.

Children, who are more in touch with their senses, are attuned to what nature has to teach them.  Let's follow them: they are harbingers. Yoga, meditation, rites of passage... They use all that is available to them in seeking the right rhythm, in cultivating the kind of benevolence that gives meaning to one\u2019s presence in the world.  This takes the form of a daily commitment, of maieutic engagement. In the wake of Timoci Naulusala or Greta Thunberg and other budding activists, they are brimming with good ideas to change our modes of life: they plant trees, cultivate vegetable gardens in cities, recycle garbage, make objects from recycled materials, organize pottery classes to reconnect with the earth and with others. In doing so, they also undergo a metamorphosis and set out to meet their true selves.<br/><br/>Key words: Sustainability and circular economy activism, common sense, poetic workwear<br/>Key pieces: Simple, practical garments with refined details, overalls, cotton seersucker smocks, knit rompers<br/>Fabrics: bamboo viscose, natural materials, washed linens, open stitch mesh, handmade knitwear<br/>Prints: wildflowers, dry vegetation, fruits from the orchard, positive symbols, talismans<br/>Colors: Warm, earthy and vegetable, half-shades, lighted by a buttercup yellow<br/><br/>#2 FANTASIA <br/><br/>Why not reach out for that hand and join the dance!<br/>You find yourself in a teeming phantasmagoria peopled with strange, half animal, half human creatures... A poetic and joyful fantasy where all wear masks, where optical illusions reign. In a setting somewhere between inextricable jungle and imaginary architectures, one camouflages or presents oneself with panache. Behind every door, a surprise! All possibles are open: one can don any costume, live in different skins, and reinvent oneself to the whim of nested identities. Therein resides the whole magic of childhood... But is it a dream or simply the carnival of life that marches in front of your astonished eyes?<br/><br/>Key words: fantasy, graphic and playful cuts, optical illusions, hidden details, color blocks, gathers, ruches, giant flounces<br/>Key pieces: tulle overdresses, tops and dresses with oversized sleeves, smocked shorts<br/>Fabrics: fluid jerseys, supple satins, tulle, textured knits<br/>Prints: extraordinary worlds, fairytales and legends, terrestrial and aquatic animals, strange plants, surreal collages, free forms, neo camo<br/>Colors: extraordinary multicolor plumages and bursts of exotic flowers, a kaki beauty treatment and deep jungle off-black<br/><br/><br/>PRESS START<br/><br/>Accustomed to instant communication and to open source information, the new urban generation seems to live accelerated lives. These 3.0 kids oscillate between reality and virtuality, between the physical and digital realms, mixing them with humor and great agility. Without judgment or self-consciousness they make an instinctive synthesis of them, guided by whatever gives them emotions. Movement: it is their watchword. In this unprecedented adventure, they unpack both future and heritage with the same appetite and appropriate both with spontaneity.

Smack Mellon is currently accepting applications from Emerging Artists to be considered for this exhibition.<br/><br/>Self-identifying women, in particular, are often overlooked as figures to be emulated, exempt from the label of \u201cgenius\u201d so readily bestowed upon men. Partially inspired by John Waters\u2019s Role Models, a pseudo-autobiography through his influences or \u201cfilth elders,\u201d the exhibition will emphasize work that presents women and women-identifying role models as sources of possibility, creativity, courage, self-fashioning and sometimes, transgression. While teens\u2019 fanatical impulse to paper their bedroom walls with imagery of their favorite stars is seen as merely an adolescent phase, Idol Worship asserts how the identification with role models is especially significant for those alienated from dominant social institutions, whether the biological family, history, or mainstream culture.<br/><br/>Idol Worship will be organized by guest curator Emily Colucci, whose proposal was selected through the Curatorial Proposal open call. To help elevate the profile of and bring greater exposure to emerging artists, this exhibition will include a combination of emerging artists chosen from an open call, as well as selected established artists. This open call is only for emerging artists, and at least half of the artists in the exhibition will be selected from this pool of applicants. An emerging artist is considered to be an artist without commercial representation who has a dedicated art practice but few opportunities to show at gallery or non-profit spaces. Submissions will be reviewed by the guest curator and Smack Mellon staff.<br/><br/>Artists whose practice includes paying tribute to, obsessing over, embodying, or otherwise complex engagements with women and women-identifying role models, heroes, idols, or filth elders, whether famous public figures, underground cult superstars, lesser known private muses, problematic faves, or unlikely sources of inspiration, are encouraged to apply. Transdisciplinary artists and cultural producers exploring the potential of role model worship as a source of sustainment are also of interest.<br/><br/>The exhibition will run from November 16 through December 29, 2019 (opening date to be confirmed).<br/><br/>Emily Colucci is a writer, curator and co-founder of Filthy Dreams, an award-winning blog analyzing art, culture and politics through a queer lens and a touch of camp. In 2016, she was awarded the Creative Capital | Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant for Filthy Dreams. In addition, Colucci has contributed to exhibition catalogues, most recently for Devan Shimoyama\u2019s Cry, Baby at the Andy Warhol Museum, artist books, and online and print magazines, such as Conde Nast\u2019s them., VICE, Salon, LA Review of Books and more. She has previously curated Night Fever at Pittsburgh\u2019s Future Tenant, and co-curated Party Out Of Bounds: Nightlife As Activism Since 1980 at New York\u2019s La MaMa Galleria with Visual AIDS, as well as its satellite installation Courtship Disorder by John Walter in London\u2019s White Cubicle Toilet Gallery at the late George & Dragon Pub.", "Application Instructions": "Submit your application using Smack Mellon\u2019s online application portal on Submittable: <a href=\"https://smackmellon.submittable.com/submit.\" target=\"_blank\">https://smackmellon.submittable.com</a> We welcome submissions of existing works and proposals for new projects.

In simpler terms, light gives life; under certain circumstances light also facilitates destruction. Capturing light in visual terms has always been a crucial element in traditional painting.

Over the past five years she has freelanced as an arts administrator, assistant, and curator for organizations such as Superchief Gallery, 4Heads/Portal, POWRPLNT and ArtMoney. Her curatorial practice is fueled by the ephemeral, the ethereal and the tactile. She is interested in further democratizing the art world and strives to consider accessible ways the public can engage with art.<br/><br/>Kat Ryals is an artist, curator and photographer based in Brooklyn, NY.

Curtis<br/><br/>Artists are invited to submit works for a group exhibition of contemporary art inspired by the architecture of Louis Kahn and the idea of inversions.  The exhibition is organized by MW Projects, with support from the Consulate General of Estonia in New York, and will be held in New York City in Fall 2019.  The main exhibition will be presented at Gallery RIVAA on Roosevelt Island and will be complemented by an outdoor exhibition of Arne Maasik\u2019s Kahn-related photographs in partnership with Four Freedoms Park and a weekend pop-up exhibition focused on performance in downtown Manhattan.<br/><br/>Born in Estonia in 1901, Louis Kahn was one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century.  His work includes the Salk Institute (La Jolla, CA), National Assembly Building (Dhaka, Bangladesh), Phillips Exeter Academy Library (Exeter, NH) and Four Freedoms Park (New York, NY).   Known for combining Modernism with the weight and dignity of ancient monuments, Kahn used simple shapes and simple materials to build preternaturally beautiful structures that sought to create transcendent experience.  He believed that structure, space and light must always be in harmony, and that it is through the material that we can understand the immaterial and universal.<br/><br/>All art forms will be considered for the exhibition, including painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, music, performance art, dance and media art.  There are also opportunities for live performances during the run of the main exhibition and the pop-up exhibition.  Artists are encouraged to investigate the conceptual underpinnings of Kahn\u2019s works and words, rather than using images of Kahn\u2019s designs and buildings.<br/><br/>All entries will be reviewed, selected and notified by Monday, September 9, 2019.<br/>Please see website for details.", "Application Instructions": "Details: www.MWprojects.art<br/>Application instructions: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/inversionskahn\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly</a><br/>Application: <a href=\"https://mwprojects.typeform.com/to/DMmZdo\" target=\"_blank\">https://mwprojects.typeform.com</a><br/>Email: info@mwprojects.art", "Country": "United States"}, "210": {"Opportunity Type": "Call for Entry/Open Call", "Location": "BROOKLYN, NY", "Website": "http://groundfloorbk.com", "Application Deadline": "06/09/2019", "Application Fee": " ", "url": "https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/fd5fdee2-31c3-4bd0-ab95-cdd797433ede", "timestamp": "2019-05-21 14:16:49", "ID": "fd5fdee2-31c3-4bd0-ab95-cdd797433ede", "Organization": "Ground Floor Gallery", "Opportunity Discipline": "All Visual Arts", "Title": "HEIRLOOM (Deadline Extended): An OPEN CALL to Help Reunite Immigrant Families", "Description": "Our Spring Pop-up Exhibition HEIRLOOM: <br/><br/>Ground Floor Gallery is pleased to announce our spring open call for \"HEIRLOOM,\"  a pop-up show in honor of the season and the significance of family!

Most artists\u2019 works, whether on a conscious or subconscious level, reflect certain personal experiences and histories. References to the past can be monumental, quotidian or intimate. Everyday objects or places take on new meaning depending on how they are interpreted or experienced. In Marcel Proust\u2019s \u201cRemembrance of Things Past,\u201d the smell and taste of a madeleine cake triggers a flood of memories and transports the author to another time and experience in his life. The show will explore the various mnemonic devices artists use to create thought provoking connections and commentaries on the passage of time.<br/><br/>Memory can be a very personal journey through one\u2019s own timeline as well as a collective experience of togetherness. We are excited to offer this broad and very thought provoking theme for this exhibit. Work in all media will be considered, including collages or sculptures incorporating everyday found objects.<br/><br/>Juror / Curator: Arianne Faber Kolb, PhD is an art historian and independent curator.

Thanks to the hidden connections of ANIMA MUNDI, all the ecosystems of the Earth, before and after the appearance of the mankind, found their equilibrium, their ways to live and to develop themselves, to transform and to evolve. All the beings of the planet, plants, minerals, animals are permeated by a secret force that has always stimulated the human thought and research.<br/><br/>The festival aims to discover these multiple forms of hidden connections between the soul and the body, the mankind and the natural elements, the natural spaces and the cities. We invite artists to show their reflections about the various ways in which the ANIMA MUNDI expresses the relationships among all the existing entities and the natural and cultural systems, and to represent by their artistic works the processes of the evolution of the world in which we all live. Artists, designers and architects are invited to talk about ANIMA MUNDI through photo reportage of cities, hidden places, photographic documentaries, personal experiences, presenting their works of photography, painting, sculpture/installation, design and architecture, video-art and live performance.<br/><br/>ITSLIQUID Group will begin a charity initiative aimed to support some of the most important no-profit organizations that are internationally involved in the environmental protection, such as United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, One Tree Planted, The Ocean Cleanup and Plastic Oceans.

The theme is: Adelante, the Future. To be held in Emeline Park, located on the shore of the Hudson River in the Village of Haverstraw, September 14th, 2019. <br/><br/>In an experimental spirit, we welcome artists interested in moving from the traditional studio, gallery and museum space into the freedom of an outdoor landscape setting with site specific and community accessible art, by making a themed-seating-parklet or vignette, sited on the water front of the Hudson. <br/><br/>PARKLETS: traditionally started by taking a lowly parking spot, encouraging their transformation into parks, playgrounds, pop-up caf\u00e9s \u2013 anything other than their intended use. We are redefining the concept by asking artists to create a small themed seating vignette within our park. <br/><br/>The Parklets should be an interactive art seating project assembled on-site with a mission to reference any aspect of the \u201ccultural landscape\u201d of this vibrant river town, celebrating the strength of melding its diverse cultural heritage, while it moves future forward over time. <br/><br/>The PARKLET may take form, in any media that can withstand the weather, and site conditions for one day. Re-cyclables are encouraged but not required. Immersive mixed media parklet installations of seating with sculpture, painting, mixed media, tactical and site performance, temporal installations, video, sound projections, or multimedia digital platforms are acceptable. <br/><br/>The festival will include live music, food, craft venders along with NYC, South Street Sea Port's Schooner, Pioneer.<br/><br/>Requests for proposals.

From the start, we caught flack from the art establishment when we broke down barriers and opened the gates to everyone from serious long-time art collectors to people who just love art and never thought they\u2019d collect. <br/><br/>As it turned out, nobody cared about the art world and their politics. Our open and transparent approach worked: imaginations have been sparked and countless new collections have been jump-started at Superfine! fairs as we continue to spread our message of a more inclusive art market across the country. Since 2015, we\u2019ve had one goal: produce badass, expertly curated art shows where \u00fcber-talented, diverse global artists meet their new fans in iconic locations across the US and beyond.<br/><br/>FAQ:<br/><br/>1) Can I share a booth with a friend?<br/><br/>Our 8' and 12' artist booths are intended for solo artists only, but our 16' and 20' booths can be shared by up to 3 artists. However, one person must be appointed as the booth representative for communication and payment purposes.<br/><br/>2) I'm a gallery, can I apply?<br/><br/>Superfine! is an artist-driven fair but we welcome progressive, forward-thinking galleries, collectives, and artist-run programs to apply. Each fair has a dedicated number (between 5 and 20) of larger booths ideal for galleries. Contact our sales team at exhibit@superfine.world for more information about coming on board as a gallery.<br/><br/>3) Can I get a discount?<br/><br/>We do offer a 5% per-fair discount for booths paid in full upfront, within three business days of a signed application. If it's immediate cash flow that's a concern, we offer options to spread booth costs over as much as a year - just ask us!<br/><br/>4) Why did you choose DTLA?<br/><br/>Our beautiful, plug-and-play DTLA venue at The Reef is not only a three minute sprinter shuttle away from the LA Art Show but is surprisingly affordable. Founded by art fair veterans, The Reef cuts our production cost which allows us to dedicate considerably more resources (more than double the budget of other fairs) to marketing the fair and our artists. Our core demographic (affluent, 26-45, creative early adopters) is also very prevalent in the DTLA and adjacent neighborhoods (Echo Park, Silver Lake, Highland Park) and our targeted marketing brings them to the fair.", "Application Instructions": "Learn more and apply: <a href=\"https://superfine.world/before-you-apply\" target=\"_blank\">https://superfine.world</a><br/>Application Deadline: January 6, 2020.

More than most people think. The Reinventing Civil Defense Project poster competition is looking for artists, designers, and other creative people to make bold, accurate, and potent visuals that can change how people see their role in the nuclear world.<br/><br/>WHO CAN ENTER: Anyone! We especially encourage students, designers, and artists, but anyone can enter. You may enter as an individual designer or a team.<br/><br/>DEADLINE: July 31, 2019, 11:59pm EDT.<br/><br/>PRIZES: A variety of monetary prizes will be awarded, up to $1,000. Your work will also be featured in the Reinventing Civil Defense August 2019 Workshop at the Stevens Institute of Technology. Teams that receive an award will split the total prize.<br/><br/>JUDGING: Your work will be judged by a panel of experts in the fields of design, nuclear weapons, risk communication, and other related fields. Posters will be judged on their visual potency (aesthetics, legibility), their message potency (communication), and their technical accuracy (major technical errors will be penalized).<br/><br/>HOW TO ENTER: Submit your document through the Google Form here. If you have difficulty submitting the file, or questions about the submission process or contest guidelines, please e-mail poster@reinventingcivildefense.org.<br/><br/><br/>FILE REQUIREMENTS: <br/>       Single File Upload per submission<br/>       24in. x 36in. @ 300 dpi<br/>       Acceptable files types: TIFF or  PDF<br/><br/>Your name or other identifying information should not appear on the poster itself \u2014 the judging will be done anonymously.<br/><br/>THE MESSAGE: The message we\u2019re looking to get out is that:<br/><br/>A single nuclear detonation in a city would be destructive and devastating, but most Americans \u2014 even those very nearby \u2014 would survive, and need to cooperate in recovery.<br/><br/>In the event of a nuclear detonation, there are strategies that can improve the chances of those in the near area to avoid becoming a casualty.<br/><br/>Nuclear weapon risk should be part of public understanding, and not ignored because people either believe it cannot happen (it can), or that it is totally unsurvivable.<br/><br/>What are the strategies for survival? The slogan that US government agencies like to use is: \u201cGet Inside. Stay Inside. Stay tuned.\u201d<br/><br/>GET INSIDE. In the event of an imminent nuclear detonation, or in the aftermath of a detonation, getting indoors is always an improvement, versus being outside. If one has the time to be picky, the center core of large buildings, and basements, are the best sorts of structures. But any indoor structure is better than being outdoors or in an automobile.<br/><br/>STAY INSIDE. If you\u2019ve survived the immediate blast, and the structure you are in is not itself a danger (it isn\u2019t on fire, it isn\u2019t about to collapse, etc.), then you should stay inside until you hear official instructions to do otherwise. You should definitely not try to evacuate on your own: nuclear fallout can create invisible hazards out of doors, and your car (much less on foot) does not provide any significant protection from it. Furthermore, if hundreds of thousands of people try to self-evacuate at the same time, they will snarl the roads, creating conditions that actively inhibit evacuation and the work of emergency responders. You don\u2019t have to stay inside for hundreds of years \u2014 but you might need to stay inside for up to three days (72 hours), until the rates of radioactivity decrease.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED. It isn\u2019t clear how easy it will be to get official information after a nuclear detonation (telephone networks might not work, for example), but you try to have a plan to get information without going out of doors. This might mean acquiring an emergency radio, for example. Again, in the case that one cannot get information from officials, you should expect to stay indoors for up to 72 hours.<br/><br/>You don\u2019t have to use this slogan in your poster, but it\u2019s useful to understand what it means about what people ought to do (and what it says they should not do).<br/><br/>The main \u201cscenario\u201d we are targeting this message for is for a single nuclear detonation in a city, as you might get from nuclear terrorism or from an attack by a state without many nuclear weapons (like North Korea). We are not giving preparedness advice for a \u201cmajor\u201d nuclear exchange (like US vs. Russia or US vs. China) which complicates the situation considerably.<br/><br/>RESOURCES: The following resources are recommended reading, and contain many useful sources of inspiration and expertise.

We face increasingly complex local and global economies, war, environmental disasters and their resulting human migrations, alongside increasing concentrations of wealth and weakened worker protections. How, as artists and cultural producers, do we address the multiplicities of factors that impact our own survival? To what extent do contemporary technologies shape our work experiences? How are artists activating contemporary dialogues around labor history, interdependence, interconnectivity and communalism? The artworld has many historic examples of protests against unfair wages and unfair institutional representation that impact artist survival, including Art Workers Coalition, United Black Artists, Guerrilla Girls, Artists of Color Organization, the New York Artists Strike, Gran Fury and Act Up. More recent examples include W.A.G.E., Arts and Labor working group, Occupy Museums, MoMA Union Workers and protests demanding MoMA, the Whitney Museum and other large museums divest from the Prison Industry, Weapons Manufacturing and Big Pharma. What is the future of institutional critique and direct social action, and what can we glean from revisiting past Art and Labor movements?<br/> <br/>The Tool Book Project is seeking submissions for its third publication: Work Book. Work Book will be a risograph magazine featuring art and writing that responds to contemporary labor issues. Work Book seeks artwork and writing that address the labor of art, art production and artworld workers, as well as art and writing that broadly considers labor, leisure and its cultural intersections. Topics may include but are not limited to: prison labor, postwork imaginaries, cultural workers, invisible labor and emotional labor in light of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality and masculine/feminine spectrums, museum labor, institutional labor practices, exchange and gift economies, manual labor, collective work and living, financial precarity, retirement and aging, ableism and mental health in art, academic and other work worlds, marxism, techno-labor, unpaid domestic labor, performing leisure, labor and land, environmental collapse and the economy, de-colonialist action, and the labor of craft and studio practice. We are especially interested in projects that examine and re-center the histories and contemporary labor/leisure from a feminist perspective that addresses the intersectional and transnational complexity of race, ethnicity, gender, class, age, body size, disability, transgender and non-binary experience and sexual orientation.<br/> <br/>The Tool Book Project is a semi-annual publication that showcases art, writing, dialogue and critical discourse from an international group of artists and cultural producers. Tool Book is also a platform for sharing resources via curated gallery shows, readings, roundtable discussions, and other public events. Sales from each publication are donated to specific social and environmental justice organizations, providing a mode of direct action for artists and writers to exchange ideas and affect positive social change.<br/> <br/>Deadline: July 5, 2019 by 11:59pm<br/>Editing will begin soon and earlier submissions are encouraged<br/>\u200b", "Application Instructions": "Apply here: <a href=\"https://www.toolbookproject.org/submissions\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.toolbookproject.org</a><br/>Contact: toolbookproject@gmail.com<br/><br/>Submission Requirements:<br/>-CV<br/>-Artist Bio (150 Words)<br/>-Project Description or Writing Abstract (350 Words)<br/>-5 Images and/or 3 time-based media clips (see details below)<br/>-OR-<br/>-Essay, Fiction, or Poetry up to 2,500 words (see details below<br/>\u200b<br/>Project Description: This can be a project statement for the artwork you are submitting or an abstract for written submissions.

Our mission is to provide platform, resources, and a safe communal space for the artistic expression of sex workers. At our events, sex workers lead discussions about issues important to the community and educate the public. Our collective includes artists who are people of color, queer, trans, and gender non-conforming, kink, and allies. We include \u201csex workers and allies\u201d as a strategy to build a wider community, provide protection by allies, and to give artist deniability of status.

Signed by President Trump on April 11, 2018, the bills are intended to hold online platforms accountable for the content of their creators and eliminate online sex trafficking. However, the bills became a suppressor to consenting and nonconsenting sex workers and police all social media users at large. This bill makes it difficult for sex workers to conduct business, take part in community activities, and share mutual aid, in online spaces. In this environment, Stigma Unbound felt that creating a safe space for the creative expression of sex workers was crucial.  <br/> <br/>Stigma Unbound has curated shows in various underground dungeons in Brooklyn, Anthology Film Archive, and Museum of Sex.  <br/><br/>*Note: Being exhibited at our events will NOT divulge your sex worker status.
